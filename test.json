Andersen is the company’s third CFO since March of 2017, when it went public.\nLara Sweet, who was serving as the company’s interim CFO as well as the chief accounting officer, will be stepping into a new role as chief people officer.\nSnap has had a less cataclysmic 2019 in the public markets compared to its two previous calendar years. Snap has nearly doubled its share price since the year’s start, though the stock still sits just above where it was one year ago.\nSnap CFO Tim Stone is resigning',
  'Glass graduates from Alphabet’s X as it scores new hardware update – TechCrunch\nGlass graduates from Alphabet’s X as it scores new hardware update\nLucas Matney\n@lucasmtny\n/\n1 month\nGoogle’s\nhead-worn smart display, Google Glass, is finally ready to move the tassel.\nAfter defining the company’s far-flung connected dreams when it was first announced in 2013, the enterprise-refocused headset is graduating from the X moonshot factory with a new hardware update that aims to make it more approachable for companies.\nAfter a soft consumer tease that was buzz-worthy if not laughably pre-mature, Google Glass Enterprise Edition was announced two years ago and the dedicated group has been plugging along since, courting businesses to hop on board.\nGoogle Glass is back with hardware focused on the enterprise\nThe design of Glass Enterprise Edition 2 doesn’t appear to be radically different from its predecessor, but under the hood there are some noteworthy changes, namely the platform now runs on Android and Android Enterprise Mobile Device Management. Those changes alone are probably enough for enterprise customers to move from the non-starter camp to giving it a first look.\nThe software upgrades are made possible by the headset’s transition to Qualcomm’s AR/VR-focused XR1 chipset. The company also says the new headset has “improved camera performance and quality,” as well as USB-C connectivity.\nCompared to something like Microsoft’s HoloLens, the Glass Enterprise Edition 2 is much more limited in capabilities, but focuses on giving users easy hands-free access to information in their periphery.\nThe Glass team joins Google’s AR/VR team and marks another key point in the company’s gradual pivot away from driving to the consumer hoop. In the past year, Google has minimized product updates to its consumer VR platform, while shuttering some groups focused on creative content production and refocusing efforts on enterprise and consumer products more heavily leveraging machine learning.\nWith its move from X, the Glass team joins other graduates that also left the moonshot factory.',
  'How I Podcast: Criminal/This Is Love’s Lauren Spohrer – TechCrunch\nHow I Podcast: Criminal/This Is Love’s Lauren Spohrer\nBrian Heater\n@bheater\n/\n1 month\nThe beauty of podcasting is that anyone can do it. It’s a rare medium that’s nearly as easy to make as it is to consume. And as such, no two people do it exactly the same way. There are a wealth of hardware and software solutions open to potential podcasters, so setups run the gamut from\xa0NPR\xa0studios to USB Skype rigs.\nWe’ve asked some of our favorite podcast hosts and producers to highlight their workflows — the equipment and software they use to get the job done. The list so far includes:\nJeffrey Cranor of Welcome to Night Vale\nJesse Thorn of Bullseye\nBen Lindbergh of Effectively Wild\nMy own podcast, RiYL\nIn the crowded world of true-crime podcasts, Criminal has managed to stand out, garnering the critical acclaim of sources ranging from The Atlantic to Entertainment Weekly. Launched in 2014 by Lauren Spohrer, Eric Mennel and host Phoebe Judge, the Chapel Hill-based series takes a deep and complex dive into its subject matter, painting a rich picture of the case files it studies.\nOn Valentine’s Day 2018, Spohrer, Judge and fellow Criminal producer Nadia Wilson launched the first season of This Is Love, a series focused on “sacrifice, obsession, and the ways in which we bet everything on each other.” Co-creator and co-producer Spohrer joins us to highlight the rig the team uses to gather recordings on the road.\nWe’re just returning home from a whirlwind reporting trip for This Is Love. We were in Italy for 10 days and recorded eight stories, moving quickly by train and car through small towns. It was the most ambitious reporting trip we’ve done, and we were lucky we met such extraordinarily kind people and discovered Pocket Coffee.\nWe like to prepare for the worst-case scenario, so we brought three recording kits with us and each carried one (me, Phoebe, and Senior Producer Nadia Wilson). We stocked up on AA batteries at Costco before we left.\nWe recorded the interviews with a Marantz PMD 661 recorder and an Audio Technica AT8035 microphone with a Rode pistol grip and a Rode WS7 Deluxe Wind Shield. We use Sony MDR-7506 headphones both for recording and for mixing. A lot of the interviews were recorded standing up, one in a fish market before the sun came up. Phoebe always records herself and the guest with the same mic. Italy is loud, and we didn’t fight that. We do plenty of interviews in pristinely silent studios. It was a nice change to let the world creep into the sound.\nBack when we started Criminal, we recorded Phoebe’s narration with the Audio Technica AT8035 in my bedroom closet with a bunch of blankets draped over her head. These days, we have a partnership with our local NPR affiliate, North Carolina Public Radio, and we use their studio to record Phoebe’s narration for both This Is Love and Criminal. They’ve got a Neumann TLM 103 microphone. We added a mic preamp (Great River ME-1NV) and a Stedman Proscreen PS101. The studio is set up to record into Adobe Audition. We upload those files to Dropbox, and then download them at home to edit and mix in Pro Tools.\nWhen we’re touring, (we’re doing 16 live shows this fall, come see us!), we produce live shows with a program called Soundboard and a Focusrite Scarlett 2i4 USB Audio Interface.\nOther tools: we pitch story ideas via email and Slack, use a shared Google Calendar to stay organized and transcribe our raw tape with Trint. Scripts are written and fact-checked collaboratively using Google Docs. We mix in Pro Tools, and when we’re happy with a mix, we send sessions to Rob Byers, Michael Rafael and/or Johnny Vince Evans to be mastered.',
  'Adobe brings its Premiere Rush video editing app to Android – TechCrunch\nAdobe brings its Premiere Rush video editing app to Android\nFrederic Lardinois\n@fredericl\n/\n1 month\nAdobe launched Premiere Rush, its newest all-in-one video editing tool that is essentially a pared-down version of its flagship Premiere Pro and Audition tools for professional video editors, in late 2018. At the time, it was only available on iOS, macOS and Windows. Now, however, it is also finally bringing it to Android.\nThere is a caveat here, though: it’ll only run on relatively new phones, including the Samsung Galaxy S9 and S10 series, Google’s Pixel\n2 and 3 phones and the OnePlus 6T.\nThe idea behind Premiere Rush is to give enthusiasts — and the occasional YouTuber who needs to quickly get a video out — all of the necessary tools to create a video without having to know the ins and outs of a complex tool like Premiere Pro. It’s based on the same technologies as its professional counterpart, but it’s significantly easier to use. What you lose in flexibility, you gain in efficiency.\nPremiere Rush is available for free for those who want to give it a try, though this “Starter Plan” only lets you export up to three projects. For full access, you either need to subscribe to Adobe’s Creative Cloud or buy a $9.99/month plan to access Rush, with team and enterprise plans costing $19.99/month and $29.99/month respectively.\nPremiere Rush CC is Adobe’s new all-in-one video editing tool for desktop and mobile',
  'Facebook’s latest account purge exposes Africa’s misinformation problem – TechCrunch\nFacebook’s latest account purge exposes Africa’s misinformation problem\nJake Bright\n1 month\nFacebook\nlast week purged a network of hundreds of pages, groups and Instagram accounts it labeled as producing “coordinated inauthentic behavior” toward Africa.\nThe activity originated in Israel and was largely targeted toward Nigeria, Senegal, Togo, Angola, Niger, and Tunisia.\nIt was mostly political in nature and primarily paid for by Archemedes Group, a global political consulting firm, Facebook said.\nThis isn’t the first case of social media platforms used as vehicles for political manipulation in Africa. Cambridge Analytica,\nthe controversial big-data actor employed in Brexit and Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential victory, was active on the continent before and after both events.\nOn its recent Africa related deletions, Facebook said:\nThe people behind this network used fake accounts to run Pages, disseminate their content and artificially increase engagement. They also represented themselves as locals, including local news organizations, and published allegedly leaked information about politicians. The Page administrators and account owners frequently posted about political news, including topics like elections in various countries, candidate views and criticism of political opponents.\nThe activity took place over 65 Facebook accounts, 161 Pages, 23 Groups, 12 events and four Instagram\naccounts.\xa0 There were 2.8 million accounts that followed one or more of these pages and 5,500 accounts joined at least one of these Groups.\nFacebook said more than $800,000 was spent on ads associated with these accounts starting in December 2012 and running as recently as April this year.\nFacebook declined to offer TechCrunch additional information on the account deletions beyond their release. But the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab (DFRL) has been digging deeper and released some initial findings in a Medium Post. In addition to connecting the accounts to activity in Ghana — a country not named in FB’s release — DFRL shed some light on fake news targeted at Nigeria’s February 2019 elections.\nExamples included a “Make Nigeria Worse Again” trolling initiative aimed at the campaign of Atiku Abubakar, who was challenger to Nigeria’s incumbent president Muhammadu Buhari — who won a second-term.\nDFRL also shared examples connected to the deleted Facebook accounts aimed at elections in Mali, Tunisia, Niger, Togo, Algeria, and Angola. It noted the ads related to this nexus of activity were paid for in U.S. dollars, Israeli Shekels, and Brazilian reals. “The spending in different currencies suggests how vast the operation was, encompassing multiple regions around the world,” said DFRL’s reporting.\nFake news on social media platforms has reared its head in Africa several times. Cambridge Analytica, backed by U.S. big-data billionaire Robert Mercer, was found to have been involved in elections in Kenya and Nigeria before its controversial role directing pro-Brexit and pro-Trump online activity in 2016. Facebook later banned Cambridge Analytica from its platform.\nSocial media driven fake news — primarily on Facebook and WhatsApp — became such an issue in Kenya’s 2017 elections the country’s parliament passed a bill in 2018, with specific punitive measures, to combat it. An investigation by the UK’s Channel 4 later revealed that Cambridge Analytica had advised the 2017 presidential campaign of Kenyan incumbent president Uhuru Kenyatta, who won in a disputed run-off vote.\nFacebook has prioritized growth in Africa, particularly since Mark Zuckerberg\nvisited the continent’s tech scene in 2016.\nThe U.S. social media company has grown Africa users to over 200 million and Facebook owned chat-tool, WhatsApp, is the most downloaded messenger app on the continent.\nBut Facebook’s recent Africa account purge shows when Facebook travels, so too does its list of pros and cons, including the ability of global actors to use it for nefarious uses in local settings.\nMark Zuckerberg’s Africa tour tracks tech’s growing interests on the continent',
  'People.ai, the predictive sales startup, raises $60M at around $500M valuation – TechCrunch\nPeople.ai, the predictive sales startup, raises $60M at around $500M valuation\nIngrid Lunden\n@ingridlunden\n/\n1 month\nThe best salespeople like to pride themselves on having both a sixth sense when it comes to closing a deal, and a healthy amount of persuasive magic to get a sale over the line. Now, a startup that says it can help any salesperson be like those top people, and help those top people be even better, has raised a large round of funding to take its own company to the next level.\nPeople.ai, which has built a platform to ingest all the data that salespeople generate in the course of their work, and then use it to provide guidance to them to help source and close more deals, is today announcing that it has raised another $60 million in funding, which it will use to continue growing the business and building partnerships with new channels, such as system integrators to target bigger enterprises.\nAlongside this, it is also launching a new product that it calls “The Wire” — a feed of insights that salespeople can access to find leads, pick up tips on how to approach them and ultimately to sell to them.\n“Some people say it’s what LinkedIn should have been,”\xa0Oleg Rogynskyy, People.ai’s founder and CEO, said in an interview. It helps, he said with a little laugh, that People.ai had managed to recruit David Flink to lead up product management at the startup. Flink joined earlier this year, having worked for nearly three years at LinkedIn on areas like search and discovery.\nThe startup is not disclosing its valuation, but sources tell us it is around $500 million — specifically in the “mid-nine-figures.” The big number is partly the result of the startup’s strong growth so far: It has already ingested 350 million sales activities, 40 million contacts, a sales pipeline of $300 billion and $100 billion in closed and won deals. Its revenues have been growing 5X year-over-year, with customers squarely so far in the tech camp that surrounds the San Francisco-based startup. They include Red Hat, Lyft, Zoom, New Relic and Splunk.\nThis latest round is being led by Iconiq, the VC that includes the family office of Marc and Priscilla Zuckerberg, among others, with participation from previous investors Andreessen Horowitz (which led its previous round\xa0just seven months ago), Lightspeed Venture Partners, GGV Capital and Y Combinator\xa0(where it was in a cohort in 2016).\nThere have been a number of startups and tech giants (Oracle and Microsoft being just two) that have been applying AI mechanics to the world of sales — specifically to help improve one aspect or another of the process. Startups range from those that use Robotic Process Automation to do some of the mundane work around data entry, to those that analyse conversations to parse them for clues to help close deals, to those that offer predictive analytics and those that are using AI to replicate sales agents altogether.\nPeople.ai’s\napproach, says Rogynskyy, is not to replace salespeople but to “supercharge” the teams by using AI to ingest “high-value, low-volume activity.” Sitting in the background, requiring no active input from the user, it picks up all the “exhaust” produced in the process of a day, and uses it to produce cheat sheets to salespeople so that they can use them when speaking to clients to help them close deals, providing interesting insights, relevant facts and other details.\nThat is now going to be augmented with The Wire, which takes some cues from social networks like Facebook and LinkedIn, providing a stream of information to the viewer, and tapping into the concept of “graphs” to source names of people and information that is most relevant to the viewer (without the ads, of course).\nRogynskyy points out that his company currently has more than 65 patents (secured and in progress) on intelligent matching, and the plan longer term will be to take the sales model and apply it to a wider range of industry verticals. These are likely to include areas like real estate, financial services and recruitment (areas where the product is already being used in smaller use cases, he noted).\n“This model is applicable to any area where you are building external, complex relationships at scale,” he said.',

Some try to schedule them as best they can. And some learn to deal with cramps that can be so bad, they are left rolling on the floor in pain.BBC Sport spoke to British Olympic hockey gold medallists Sam Quek and Kate Richardson-Walsh, England footballer Alex Greenwood and Olympic athlete Eilish McColgan about the impact periods have on their sporting lives.\nHow do periods affect athletes?McColgan struggled with period pains as a teenager, experiencing bad cramps and flushing hot and cold before vomiting to a point where "it would wipe out maybe four hours of my day, just from the pain".More recently, the 28-year-old had an unusual hamstring injury caused by a "perfect storm" of factors, including her period."I had to pull out of a race in Rome last year - I\'d taken my period and I felt flat, heavy, tired," the Scot told BBC Sport."I got home and I was frustrated to have dropped out of a race for the first time. I went on the treadmill and did a really hard session."It didn\'t help that I\'d been sitting around all day travelling, and then taken my period, but two days later I pulled my hamstring. There\'s no doubt in my mind it was all connected."They scanned it and the radiologist said he\'d never really seen that much inflammation in one muscle before."Periods \'not given focus\' within sport - Wales netballer Clare JonesThe majority of research on how female athletes should train is based on what has worked for men - but that comes with obvious problems."Women have a monthly cycle of hormones, which have powerful effects on our bodily system, emotions and mood," said Dr Emma Ross, co-head of physiology at the English Institute of Sport (EIS)."This difference alone has the potential to mean women will adapt to training differently at different points of their cycle."\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nWatch: \'My period was so bad I had to come off\'\nResearch has suggested that anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries - the most serious kind of knee damage - are more prevalent in female athletes than men, and they may be more prone to injury and illness at certain times.Oestrogen, the hormone that repairs and thickens the uterus lining during menstruation, can increase the elasticity of joints in the days before ovulation. This can lead to ACL problems, which occur if a knee or lower leg is twisted. It can also lead to bone injuries, as oestrogen helps develop strong, dense bones.The EIS has launched the SmartHer campaign, which prioritises female health, dealing with topics from periods to urinary incontinence, and supports athletes during their careers.Dr Ross believes women "often normalise a lot of these things, and just put up with them"."The elite sporting environment is dominated by males in roles such as coach and performance director," she said."It can create an environment that often lacks an intuition about how female-specific factors may affect athletes."According to Dr Ross, more than 70% of women have not received education about their menstrual cycle and exercise - something McColgan thinks could be hindering people from talking about it."It\'s crazy that, in 2019, we don\'t really have an answer as to how we can continue being healthy and performing at a good level," she said."I think a lot of people might be shocked that athletes even have periods."Why do we monitor periods?For Quek, who was part of the British hockey team that won Olympic gold in 2016, filling in information about her menstrual cycle was part of her morning routine.The 30-year-old - and her Great Britain and England team-mates - used an app on her phone to fill in a monitoring form. It would record her heart rate, the colour of her urine, how long she had slept for, and if she had any muscle soreness.And there was a box to tick if that day was the first day of her menstrual cycle.Former GB captain Richardson-Walsh, 39, said: "It started in the lead-up to London 2012 - our strength and conditioning coach, Dave Hamilton, found there was a pattern with soft-tissue injuries."We would send a text on day one of our cycle, so he could mark it on our training calendar. He tried to monitor, as much as you can with a squad of 28 women, our training loads depending on our menstrual cycle."The monitoring was optional. It was, as Richardson-Walsh says, a case of players being curious about the changes in their body, and an awareness of how mood, diet and nutrition could change as they menstruate.Quek says the group were open with each other - when they were on their periods, players would "put an arm around someone and say you\'ve got the red sash" - and the data collected was designed to give the staff a better understanding of their players\' bodies, rather than being used as an excuse not to select them for a match.\nApps similar to this can be used to monitor periods based on monthly data input by the user"In the gym, in conversation with staff, you might lift slightly lighter weights during your cycle," Richardson-Walsh adds."Dave found ligament and tendon tissues were less strong during your cycle, so you could do less turning, or fewer repetitions of turning, to avoid twisting an ankle or a knee."Manchester United Women\'s defender Greenwood also uses an app with club and country to track her periods."Our doctors at United and England are all female, so they all understand and they know how it feels," says Greenwood, 25."It\'s the human body, it\'s how it works. And if you\'re unable to train, then so be it."How do athletes compete on their period?For McColgan, it is all about preparation."The big one really is painkillers, so if I know I\'m coming on to my period in a day\'s time, I can get the stomach cramps calmed down," she said."If I wait until the day, I\'ll be rolling about on the floor it is that sore."I can\'t really function, I can\'t really drive, I can\'t do anything, so I\'ll take painkillers for a couple of days before."McColgan tried a contraceptive pill, which can make periods lighter and ease symptoms such as cramp, but believes it was too strong for what she describes as "my low hormones".Her emotions fluctuated: she says she "cried for six weeks" and her period symptoms would last far longer than the usual seven days.A disappointing European Indoors, where McColgan finished seventh in the 3,000m final after starting her period on the morning of the race, led her to seek advice from other athletes."I was OK until the past couple of years but, at this level, you\'re competing at Olympic Games and I need to get something to try and calm things down," she said."Some athletes gave me a few different options - such as looking at the coil, and pills that maybe have a lower level of hormones."I saw a gynaecologist through British Athletics and he spoke about trying different pills but the fact I am menstruating means I\'m healthy, and he was worried about putting me on the pill in case it played havoc with something else."It has been suggested that taking the pill could lower a woman\'s risk of tearing her ACL.But tablets aren\'t guaranteed to control period pains - or not affect an athlete\'s performance.Britain\'s Jess Judd was left in tears after failing to qualify for the 800m semi-finals at 2013 World Athletics Championships. Judd had been due to start her period and had been given norethisterone to delay it, which she believed "played with my hormones more".Each woman\'s body reacts differently.Richardson-Walsh struggled with cramping and heavy periods as a teenager, and again since retiring in 2016. Greenwood can feel heavy-legged; Quek would wear her \'period pants\' whenever she began her cycle. McColgan is working with her body as best as she can. But, as she wrote on Instagram, sometimes she will be "like a walrus trying to run around in circles" in front of a crowd of thousands.BBC Sport has launched #ChangeTheGame this summer to showcase female athletes in a way they never have been before. Through more live women\'s sport available to watch across the BBC this summer, complemented by our journalism, we are aiming to turn up the volume on women\'s sport and alter perceptions.

His wife has called for his feeding tubes to be withdrawn; his parents insist he be kept alive.Mr Lambert\'s mother Viviane, 73, hailed the latest ruling as "a very big victory" in her struggle to maintain her son\'s life support.\n"They are going to restore nutrition and give him drink. For once I am proud of the courts," she said.Doctors had earlier on Monday halted the nutrition and hydration Lambert receives, in line with the wishes of his wife and other relatives.An earlier judicial ruling had said Mr Lambert should be removed from life support and that process had begun before Monday evening\'s dramatic reversal by the Paris Court of Appeal.How did we get here? The case has been the subject of judicial rulings, going as far as the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).Europe\'s top court upheld the decision of a French court to allow Mr Lambert to be taken off life support. However, doctors then did not carry out the plan - amid security concerns raised by Mr Lambert\'s father, who feared there was a plan to kidnap him.\nImage copyright\nGetty Images\nImage caption\nViviane Lambert has fought for her son\'s life to continue\nThe high-profile case has proved extremely divisive in France, where euthanasia is illegal but doctors are allowed to put terminally ill patients into deep sedation.Why did the case go to court?Mr Lambert is a former psychiatric nurse who has been in a quadriplegic state of paralysis, with minimal consciousness, since his accident. He has been kept alive with food and water delivered through a gastric tube. He can breathe without artificial aid and occasionally opens his eyes.After several years of trying to improve his condition, Mr Lambert\'s medical team recommended in 2013 that care should stop, in consultation with his wife Rachel.\nImage copyright\nGetty Images\nImage caption\nRachel Lambert insists her husband would "never have wanted to be kept in this state"\nBecause the rest of his family were not consulted, the decision was challenged and a lengthy legal battle over his care began. His wife, six of his siblings and his nephew favour artificial life-support being ended - but his devoutly Roman Catholic parents, Pierre and Viviane, and two other siblings have remained adamant it should continue.At the height of the row, in 2015, Mr Lambert\'s parents released a video via a conservative Catholic website on YouTube which they said showed him reacting to family members.Doctors involved in his care complained that the video was misleading about his condition and manipulative to the wider public.Calls for interventionThe UN\'s Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities had called on France to intervene and delay the move to withdraw the life support while they investigated his case further. France\'s ministry of health said it was not bound by the committee.\nImage copyright\nGetty Images\nImage caption\nThe case has become central to France\'s "right to die" debate\nMinister Agnès Buzyn said at that point, before Monday\'s ruling, that "all legal appeals have been exhausted".The European Court of Human Rights had rejected a further request on Monday by Mr Lambert\'s parents and siblings for the UN committee\'s calls to be observed. The court said they "had submitted no new evidence such as to induce it to change its position" on the matter.In an open letter published over the weekend, Mr Lambert\'s parents asked President Emmanuel Macron for help. "Mr President, Vincent Lambert will die without hydration in the week of 20 May if you do nothing and you are the last and only one able to intervene," read the letter, signed by lawyers for family members opposed to ending the life support. "In France, in 2019, no one should die of hunger and thirst."Mr Macron rejected the calls to intervene, saying "the decision to stop treatment was taken after a constant dialogue between his doctors and his wife, who is his legal representative".\nRelated TopicsLife supportFranceEuthanasia and assisted dying\nShare this story\nAbout\xa0sharing\nEmail\nFacebook\nMessenger\nMessenger\nTwitter\nPinterest\nWhatsApp\nLinkedIn\nMore on this story\nWhat\'s the difference between assisted suicide and euthanasia?\n8 February 2019\nWho was Alfie Evans and what was the row over his treatment?\n28 April 2018\nAlfie Evans: When are parents denied the final say?\n28 April 2018\nAssisted suicide: Paul Lamb renews bid for right to die\n7 May 2019\nTop Stories\nJavid knocked out of Tory leadership contest\nBoris Johnson leads the race to be next Tory leader while Michael Gove overtakes Jeremy Hunt to move into second place.\n20 June 2019\nTory leadership race final ballot\n19 June 2019\nAbuse claims \'horrendous\' says former MP\n20 June 2019\nFeatures\nHow my sleepy hometown became a violent crime hotspot\nWhere giving vaccines can get you killed\nVideo\nChina\'s vanishing beards and mosques\nThe cafe where customers don\'t have to pay\nThe fake minister in a silicone mask who stole millions\nBrexit: Where do Conservative leadership candidates stand?\nVideo\nHow a four-day week has changed our lives\nWhy it\'s so hard to stop a cult\nVideo\nFighting vaccine fears in the UK\nElsewhere on the BBC\nEqual Playing Field\nBreaking world records to get women into football\nFull article Equal Playing Field\nDaily news briefing direct to your inbox\nSign up for our newsletter\nFull article Daily news briefing direct to your inbox\nWhy you can trust BBC News\nBBC News Navigation\nEurope\nSections\nEurope\nEuropean Elections 2019\nHome\nUK\nUK Home\nEngland\nN.

Martin: ending Game of Thrones is really hard\nshare\ntweet\nLinkedin\nReddit\nPocket\nFlipboard\nEmail\nImage: HBO\nWe all owe George R.R. Martin an apology. HBO’s Game of Thrones, the adaptation of Martin’s unfinished book series A Song of Ice and Fire, has concluded, wrapping up nearly every outstanding plot point in an abbreviated sprint to the end in the final episode, “The Iron Throne.” Overall, it was a tidy ending to what felt like a largely unsatisfying season, one that saw the most-discussed TV show of the past few years go out, not with a bang, but with a rushed, corner-cutting whimper.\nWriting the ending to Game of Thrones is, in fact, harder than it looks.\nImage: HBO\nWarning: spoilers ahead for all of Game of Thrones as well as the published books\n“Where’s the next book?”\n“Where’s the next book?”\nThe question has been on the minds of Martin’s fans since the beginning. Whenever he announces a new project, makes a press appearance, or blogs about his favorite sports teams, it’s always the first response. “Where’s the next book?” has become a kind of meme that’s spawned endless cultural spinoffs, from Neil Gaiman’s “George R.R. Martin is not your bitch” column to a Martin plush doll that says “I’m working on it,” among other things. When Martin addresses the question at all, his answer is invariably the same: these things take time.\nThe hurried ending to the TV adaptation of his books suggests he’s been right all along.\nMartin originally published A Game of Thrones, the first book in a proposed fantasy trilogy, in 1996. The tale, now at five books and counting, obviously grew in the telling. In an interview with The Guardian in 2011, he described himself as a “gardener” type of writer who works out the story as he goes, as opposed to an “architect,” who plots out all the details ahead of time.\nImage: HBO\nAnyone following the novels over the years has seen the effects of Martin’s exploratory writing style. By the time the fourth book, A Feast for Crows, rolled around in 2005, Martin split the narrative in half, temporarily setting aside many of his most popular characters to focus on new areas of his rapidly expanding world. The interval between his books has grown with each volume. Book two in the series, A Clash of Kings, was published just two years after the first book. As of today, it’s been almost eight years since book five, A Dance With Dragons, and there’s still no release date for the sequel, The Winds of Winter, let alone the supposedly final seventh novel, A Dream of Spring.\n‘Game of Thrones’ was a gamble for HBO\nHBO’s Game of Thrones hit the scene in 2011, just months before A Dance With Dragons arrived on shelves. At the time, few readers expected the show to be a hit. It was a high-concept fantasy series based on a series of popular but still niche doorstop-sized books, airing exclusively on a pricey premium cable network best known for gritty, realism-based shows like The Wire and The Sopranos. It was a gamble, and while HBO was confident even before the show started that it would succeed, for most, the question wasn’t whether Game of Thrones would outpace Martin’s books, it was whether it would even survive long enough to dig deeply into his source material.\nBack when Game of Thrones started, the adaptation was also far more straightforward. The first season covered the contents of the first book, and the second season (greenlit just days after the series premiered) took on the second book. By the third season, the intricacies of Martin’s world started to hit the show, and A Storm of Swords — the third book — was split into two seasons.\nImage: HBO\nSo it wasn’t until 2014, ahead of that fourth season (covering the back half of book three), that concerns about Martin’s books being left in the dust began to really take root. “I’m hopeful that I can not let them catch up with me,” Martin said in an interview with Vanity Fair at the time, hoping the show would spend a fifth, sixth, and seventh season adapting books four and five, by which time he would have finished book six, for another season or two of breathing room. The idea was that he might get A Dream of Spring done before the show got its say.\nGRRM never wanted to get left behind\nMartin’s mindset here is revealing: in his mind, the show was going to run far longer than it actually did, telling a story at the same level of detail as the previous seasons, and as his novels. After all, that’s how the first seasons worked, and he’d always had the time to progress at his own rate.\nObviously, that wasn’t the case, and following season 4, Game of Thrones started to blitz through Martin’s remaining source material. Season 5 ate up most of the plot of A Feast for Crows and A Dance With Dragons, largely by sticking to the action and avoiding some of Martin’s more meandering plots. And while Martin tried to get The Winds of Winter out before the sixth season of the show surpassed the novels, he simply couldn’t hit the deadline.\nImage: HBO\nThat left Benioff and Weiss in their own, uncharted waters. The show had to go on, and while they could work with Martin as much as they could, they were going to be the ones to pen the ending, especially after Martin stepped down from writing episodes of the series after season 4. Ostensibly, that was to focus more on writing The Winds of Winter.\nMartin couldn’t help ‘Game of Thrones’ stick the landing\nPart of the problem was simply in what George R.R. Martin has given the showrunners. Per Martin’s own admission, Benioff and Weiss “know certain things. I’ve told them certain things. So they have some knowledge, but the devil is in the details. I can give them the broad strokes of what I intend to write, but the details aren’t there yet.” Simply put: Martin couldn’t help Game of Thrones stick the landing, because he himself wasn’t positive how he’d put the pieces together. For example, Martin’s original ending from his series proposal would have had Jon, Arya, and Tyrion in a love triangle, which isn’t in the show, and now seems unlikely to pop up in the remaining books. It’s proof that even Martin’s idea of the series has changed over time.\nBut the lack of new material and the rapidly shifting timescales left Benioff and Weiss in an impossible situation. They had to pick up one of the largest fantasy TV series of all time, at perhaps its widest possible expansion of story, with characters scattered across the world and plotlines left dangling. And they had to bring it in for a satisfying ending. It’s been done before — famously, author Brandon Sanderson brought Robert Jordan’s epic fantasy series The Wheel of Time to a conclusion after Jordan’s death. But Jordan had left copious notes and plans for his final novel, and even then, it took Sanderson (working closely with Jordan’s wife and editor, Harriet McDougal) three books to close out what Jordan had hoped would be a single novel.\nImage: HBO\nAnd Game of Thrones is a very different beast. Instead of detailed notes, the writers only had Martin’s outline — a good start, but it obviously left large blanks to fill in. They had to come up with the mechanics and specifics of the story, a task so difficult that even the story’s creator has been stuck on it for the better part of a decade. And they didn’t just have to finish Martin’s tale, they had to make compelling television, the kind that could sustain the culture of hype and discussion that has exploded around the show.\nThere’s also the time factor. Martin wanted more seasons. According to an Entertainment Weekly interview, HBO was entirely willing to pay for more Game of Thrones, but Benioff and Weiss drew the line and wanted to wrap things up, presumably so they could move on to other projects, like their upcoming Star Wars trilogy and the controversial modern slavery series Confederate.\nIn the end, ‘Game of Thrones’ just didn’t have enough time\nLooked at through that lens, the inconsistency of the last few seasons — and season 8 in particular — makes a lot of sense. It’s practically a miracle that Benioff, Weiss, and the rest of the writers were able to give viewers anything resembling an ending at all, given their self-imposed time frame. Martin has been telling fans for years that good, rich drama takes time. And the show didn’t have enough of that time, given how it compressed the series’ conclusion.\nBut it’s important to remember that even in a world where Martin’s series was written before a single second of the show was shot, Game of Thrones still likely wouldn’t have run for a dozen seasons, or told a tale on the same level that the books hopefully will. Martin’s story is too complex and internal to fully fit on a screen. His dream of taking three seasons for books four and five was unrealistic. Compression was always coming for the story on Game of Thrones. The only question was whose story would be crammed into the time the show had left — Martin’s, or someone else’s.\nImage: HBO\nEven if the show did have the time and funding to adapt Martin’s books shot for shot, plenty of season 8’s problems do rest on the writers, who clearly chose to emphasize bigger battles and big dramas at the expense of character foundations, plot consistency, and in some cases, common sense. The last few seasons gave the writers more control than ever, and they used that to make different decisions than Martin had in his books — decisions that likely were based on Game of Thrones growing to cater to a mass market audience far larger and broader than Martin’s books ever had. It’s easy for fans to play armchair quarterback and describe how they would have saved the show’s final seasons, but it has to be approached with the context that at this point, Benioff and Weiss were playing a very different game.\nBenioff and Weiss were playing a very different game\nBut while HBO’s Game of Thrones may have given everyone more appreciation for Martin’s struggle, there’s no guarantee he’ll get it right either when the time comes, if he finishes the series at all. His increasing side projects, like his lengthy Targaryen history Fire and Blood or his Westeros companions like The World of Ice and Fire, seem like evidence that he’s struggling to weave his plot threads back together for his own ending. A 2013 interview at io9 saw Martin dig into some of those struggles, as he contemplated a five-year time jump to try to move the plot forward, or the infamous “Meereenese knot” of Dany’s story in A Dance with Dragons, which took Martin years to unravel.\nImage: HBO\nWe still don’t (and may never know) how closely Martin’s intended ending resembles the one on the show. Maybe Jon’s parentage was always intended to be a red herring, Daenerys was always going to raze King’s Landing, and Arya was supposed to kill the Night King — or his book equivalent, if one ever shows up. Maybe, like Martin’s originally pitched ending, whatever he planned back when he briefed Benioff and Weiss has already changed in his writing process.\nUltimately, though, Game of Thrones’ finale feels like it’s more about fans’ impossibly high expectations than about the actual merits of the show’s ending. Martin’s novels started the cycle more than 20 years ago. Many of the show’s fans today weren’t even alive when the first book came out. And the pressure of delivering something that would satisfy everyone has only grown in the intervening two-plus decades, compounded by the show’s massive popularity.\nA Song of Ice and Fire fans were already heavily invested before the show started, and the show’s popularity has driven expectations progressively higher, as viewers picked apart and theorized over every frame and page to anticipate where things might go next. We’ve seen time and again how that level of investment can shift into a more toxic feeling of ownership, leading to absurd temper-tantrum petitions demanding the ending be remade to meet one person’s personal expectations.\nImage: HBO\nRegardless of how any given viewer took the show’s ending, that doesn’t invalidate the incredible things Game of Thrones and A Song of Ice and Fire have done. There are still seasons of incredible storytelling on display, with career-making performances from talented actors, scenes like Tyrion’s trial, Jaime’s desperate confession about becoming the Kingslayer, or basically any time Dame Diana Rigg was on-screen as Olenna Tyrell. There were sequences that changed the rules for what a TV show could pull off, like the Battle of the Blackwater or the time Game of Thrones broke a record for setting stunt people on fire. The worldwide fandom was its own remarkable phenomenon, a cultural moment where it felt like for once, everyone in the world was banding together to experience something collectively.\nMaybe GRRM will get it right, or maybe no one ever will\nIf the debate over the ending of Game of Thrones is anything to go by, George R.R. Martin is still facing an uphill battle in finishing this series himself. In a blog post published after the finale, he reassured fans that he would have a finished series for them one day and his ending, filled with different characters and a far denser medium that the show offered. (Although he dodged the question of whether his ending would be the same as the show’s.)\nMaybe he’ll get it right, in the months or years it takes him. Maybe no one ever will. But looking back at the final moments of the show, with all its focus on new beginnings for all of the characters we’ve gotten to know over the past decade and for Westeros itself, maybe endings aren’t everything. Maybe it’s worth it all for the journey.\nMore From\nThe Verge\nGood Deals\nXbox One controllers, natively supported in iOS 13, are much cheaper today\nPlus, save on Logitech PC accessories and Samsung’s Galaxy S10 lineup\nThe Fujifilm X-T2 mirrorless camera body is cheaper than ever\nSave on the 2016 camera, the latest iPad Air, and more\nYou can still save $200 on a Samsung Galaxy S10E\nNew deals, plus a few Father’s Day offers that are still active\nGoogle’s loud Home Max speaker is $40 off for Verge readers\nA handful of exclusive deals for you\nThe Google Pixel 3 and 3 XL are $300 off at B&H Photo\nThe sale price is limited to 64GB, ‘not pink’ models\nMore in Good Deals\nVerge3.0_Logomark_Color_1\nSign up for the\nnewsletter\nCommand Line\nCommand Line delivers daily updates from the near-future.\nEmail (required)\nSubscribe\nBy signing up, you agree to our Privacy Policy and European users agree to the data transfer policy.\nThis Article has a component height of 74.

Josh Hawley (R-MO) announced today that he plans to introduce a bill that would create a Do Not Call list but for data tracking.\nHawley’s Do Not Track Act would, if approved, allow people using an online service to opt out of any data tracking that isn’t necessary for that particular service to properly work. It would create a national list that would provide people with an option to block any secondary data tracking and penalize companies that continued to collect unnecessary data.\n“Big tech companies collect incredible amounts of deeply personal, private data from people without giving them the option to meaningfully consent,” Hawley said. “They have gotten incredibly rich by employing creepy surveillance tactics on their users, but too often the extent of this data extraction is only known after a tech company irresponsibly handles the data and leaks it all over the internet.”\nHawley’s bill is similar to a draft do-not-track bill published by DuckDuckGo CEO Gabriel Weinberg earlier this month, who presented it as a way to rein in the power of targeted advertising. “People are fed up with Big Tech’s privacy abuses and are actively seeking out ways to protect themselves,” Weinberg said in a statement. “This bill finally closes this Do Not Track loophole while still taking advantage of the signal’s preexisting technical implementation and mainstream consumer adoption.”\nThe Do Not Track standard was first introduced in 2009, but it fizzled out as browsers and ad networks were unable to come to a consensus about how to treat the opt-out. But millions of users still have their browsers set to Do Not Track, and the new bill would add severe penalties for ignoring the signal. If a company like Google were to knowingly collect secondary datasets from users who opt out, the company would be penalized up to $1,000 a day per person — so long as the total is over $100,000. If a company collected the data unknowingly, it would still be required to pay out $50 a day per person.\nNext Up In\nPolicy\nGood Deals\nXbox One controllers, natively supported in iOS 13, are much cheaper today\nPlus, save on Logitech PC accessories and Samsung’s Galaxy S10 lineup\nThe Fujifilm X-T2 mirrorless camera body is cheaper than ever\nSave on the 2016 camera, the latest iPad Air, and more\nMore in Good Deals\nVerge3.0_Logomark_Color_1\nSign up for the\nnewsletter\nCommand Line\nCommand Line delivers daily updates from the near-future.\nEmail (required)\nSubscribe\nBy signing up, you agree to our Privacy Policy and European users agree to the data transfer policy.\nThis Article has a component height of 5.

Van Hollen said\nBy\nMakena Kelly@kellymakena\nMay 20, 2019,\n4:11pm EDT\nShare\nTweet\nShare\nShare\nLawmakers applaud Google for revoking Huawei’s Android license\nshare\ntweet\nLinkedin\nReddit\nPocket\nFlipboard\nEmail\nPhoto by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\nOver the weekend, news broke that Google revoked Huawei’s Android license for new devices, cutting off the Chinese tech company’s access to critical Google apps. Now, longtime Huawei critics on Capitol Hill are applauding Google’s move and encouraging other tech companies to follow suit.\nLawmakers like Sens. Marco Rubio (R-FL), Tom Cotton (R-AR), and Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) have been sounding the alarm on Chinese companies like Huawei for years, and in statements provided to The Verge today, approved of Google’s decision. Rubio called the action “wise,” and Van Hollen said it sent a “clear message.”\nRelated\nThe case against Huawei, explained\nRegulators, lawmakers, and the Defense Department have long warned that Chinese tech companies like Huawei and ZTE pose a significant national security threat to the United States, despite much of the intelligence information they cite being classified.\nThe criticism translated into action\nThe criticism translated into action when lawmakers attached language to a must-pass military spending bill last summer that banned government agencies from purchasing Chinese telecom equipment. And just last week the administration escalated tensions when President Trump signed an executive order giving the Commerce Department the ability to block US companies from purchasing foreign-made telecom equipment. Now, Google is extending this ban privately by revoking Huawei’s ability to use the company’s Android operating system.\nThe Google Play Store and Play Protect will continue to function on current Huawei devices, but any new smartphones and tablets will not support many of these critical apps.\nRubio and Cotton were two lawmakers who spurred the Hill discussion on Huawei and its potential security risks. In statements on Monday, the lawmakers applauded Google’s move.\n“With Google’s wise decision today, we’re already starting to see significant impact in the tech sector after the Trump Administration announced plans to blackball Huawei by adding it to the Commerce Department’s Entity List.” Rubio said. “The United States is leading the way as it urges allies and partners, such as Britain, to avoid entangling themselves with Huawei, ZTE, and other Chinese state-directed telecoms firms.”\nCotton spearheaded legislation at the beginning of the year that would ban the export of US parts to Chinese companies like Huawei if they were to violate export control or sanction laws. In a statement Monday, Cotton said, “Chinese spy companies like Huawei pose serious threats to our national security. American companies ought to follow Google’s lead by severing ties with Huawei.”\n“Huawei and ZTE pose a threat to our privacy and national security”\nSen. Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) co-sponsored the Cotton bill, making it a bipartisan effort, and told The Verge, “This Administration has finally recognized what we’ve been raising the alarm about in Congress — Huawei and ZTE pose a threat to our privacy and national security — and they should have no place in our telecommunications infrastructure.”\n“Google’s actions, in response to the Commerce Department’s order, are part of our clear message that bad actors will not be tolerated,” Van Hollen continued.\nSen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) was more skeptical of Google’s move, suggesting that the company could have revoked the license before Trump signed last week’s executive order.\n“Google’s decision today raises more questions — how many other partnerships do they have with firms like Huawei that could be ended with the flip of a switch?” Hawley said. “The reality is that until the administration took action, Google turned a blind eye to the practices of Huawei because they wanted to turn a profit.”\nThe Federal Communications Commission has also ramped up efforts against Chinese companies. Last week, the FCC voted to block China Mobile from integrating into US networks and commissioners like Brendan Carr have even called for national security agencies to investigate whether China Unicom and China Telecom should be removed from them entirely.\nIn this Storystream\nHuawei vs. Trump: all the news about the Chinese phone maker’s messy relationship with the US\nHonor 20 launches globally this week, but you probably shouldn’t buy it\nLawmakers applaud Google for revoking Huawei’s Android license\nThe two most anticipated foldable phones are starting off to disastrous launches\nView all 77 stories\nNext Up In\nPolicy\nGood Deals\nXbox One controllers, natively supported in iOS 13, are much cheaper today\nPlus, save on Logitech PC accessories and Samsung’s Galaxy S10 lineup\nThe Fujifilm X-T2 mirrorless camera body is cheaper than ever\nSave on the 2016 camera, the latest iPad Air, and more\nYou can still save $200 on a Samsung Galaxy S10E\nNew deals, plus a few Father’s Day offers that are still active\nGoogle’s loud Home Max speaker is $40 off for Verge readers\nA handful of exclusive deals for you\nThe Google Pixel 3 and 3 XL are $300 off at B&H Photo\nThe sale price is limited to 64GB, ‘not pink’ models\nMore in Good Deals\nVerge3.0_Logomark_Color_1\nSign up for the\nnewsletter\nCommand Line\nCommand Line delivers daily updates from the near-future.\nEmail (required)\nSubscribe\nBy signing up, you agree to our Privacy Policy and European users agree to the data transfer policy.\nThis Article has a component height of 21.

The color will reportedly be called “Cardinal Red,” and it will be available for both the Samsung Galaxy S10 and S10 Plus, with no mention of whether it will be available for the budget S10E. There’s no exact date given for when the new color will be released, but Quandt says it’s “coming soon.”\nSignificantly, there’s also no mention of which countries the new color is expected to launch in. In May last year, Samsung announced that the Galaxy S9 would soon be available in red and gold, but in the end only the gold color actually ended up coming to the US. Last year’s red color remained exclusive to China and South Korea.\nSamsung Galaxy S10 and S10+ in "Cardinal Red" coming soon.More pics (scroll to bottom):S10: https://t.co/1MeZIoFaMES10+: https://t.co/Ap8KHuA1K9 pic.twitter.com/mMc46qi5pT— Roland Quandt (@rquandt) May 21, 2019\nIf this leak is accurate, it would bring the total number of S10 colors up to five including white, black, green, and blue.

  'Seraphim Space Camp launches its latest mission, with 7 spacetech startups – TechCrunch\nSeraphim Space Camp launches its latest mission, with 7 spacetech startups\nMike Butcher\n@mikebutcher\n/\n1 month\nU.K. space accelerator Seraphim Space Camp appeared last year as the first-ever U.K. spacetech accelerator, and being, frankly, the only accelerator of its type, it has quickly shored-up a number of partnership links and hoovered up many of the startups in the… space.\nAs is traditional with accelerators, it’s unveiled its latest cohort of startups.\nThe “Mission 3” accelerator programme consists of seven new startups and will be a nine-week programme, culminating in an Investor Day. The first two cohorts (16 companies) have, says Seraphim, now collectively raised or had offers of around £20 million in private investment and grants over the last nine months and have created 58 job opportunities since completing the programme.\nThe initiative has a number of high-profile partners such as MoD’s Defence Science and Technology Lab (Dstl), unmanned aircraft systems company AeroVironment,\nground station services provider Kongsberg Satellite Services and leading satellite provided Eutelsat. They join returning partners Airbus, Rolls-Royce, Dentons, Cyient, Inmarsat, the European Space Agency and SA Catapult.\nHere’s a rundown of the companies in their own words:\naXenic is a global leader in the design, development and production of optical modulators for communications and sensing. It has developed a revolutionary optical modulator which is a vital component to transfer high quantities of data through satellite links. Its strongly patented solution is a fraction of the weight and size of existing solutions whilst still providing greater bandwidth.\nConstelIR (Fellowship) is a spin-out from Fraunhofer University. It is the first company to map precise on-earth temperatures from a constellation of satellites it plans to launch. This orbital temperature monitoring system will be 3% of the cost of existing solutions without losing measurement accuracy.\nHawa Dawa combines its proprietary IoT smart sensor data with other sources of data (including satellite data) to give highly accurate data on air quality. Within two years’ traction with Siemens, IBM, SwissCom, Swiss Pos as well as 8 cities in Germany demonstrates that the company’s end-to-end solution is really needed by the market.\nMethera Global plans to launch a constellation flexible and dynamic satellites, focusing all of its bandwidth to a small area of target regions from multiple satellites. Providing an increase in capacity which is 10 times greater than planned systems, initial customers are the likes of emergency response services helping communities who don’t currently have access to the internet — 4 billion of the world’s population.\nTrik is an enterprise drone 3D mapping software for structural inspection with a unique platform. Its platform transforms the data into a customisable 3D model which can be updated on a regular basis.\nXonaspace (Fellowship) uses an XPS and LEO satellite constellation for extremely precise GPS systems, with early end applications including autonomous vehicles.\nVeoware’s vision is to industrialise the space sector so that hardware, software and data become easily accessible and rapidly available for the benefit of humankind. This is made possible due to its team of world renowned experts with 100+ years of experience.',

It makes sense — getting a good fit requires the sort of exact measurements that can be accommodated by scanning and printing. Dental, in particular, has been a key driver, perhaps most notably in the case of Invisalign, which houses a warehouse full of printers.\nToday at the Rapid 2019 conference in Detroit, SmileDirectClub announced that it’s making a major investment in HP’s industrial Multi Jet Fusion systems.The warehouse of 49 printers marks the largest deployment of the systems in the U.S. They’ll be put work around the clock, churning out teeth-straightening molds.\nWhen all is up and running, the systems will be capable of producing up to 50,000 molds a day. If all goes according to plan, that should account for more than 18 million in a year. HP says its machines are currently responsible for around 99% of SmileDirect’s 3D printer manufacturing. This latest announcement effectively doubles its investment in the technology.\nIt’s a space worth watching for anyone with a passing interest in the technology. After years of experimentation and lofty promises, orthodontics represent a large-scale, real-world use for the tech.',
  'US mitigates Huawei ban by offering temporary reprieve – TechCrunch\nUS mitigates Huawei ban by offering temporary reprieve\nDanny Crichton\n1 month\nTwo steps forward, one step back.\nThe Trump administration has seemingly been trying to calibrate its strategy around its intensifying trade dispute with China. Last week, it effectively banned Huawei from importing U.S. technology, a decision that forced several American companies, including Google, to partly sever their relationships with the Chinese handset and telecom provider.\nNow, in an unpublished draft of a note in the Federal Register, the Department of Commerce and its Bureau of Industry and Security announced that Huawei would receive a “90-day temporary general license” to continue to use U.S. technology that it already has a license to. New technology and mobile phone models requiring new licenses would still need to apply for them — and those licenses are unlikely to be approved, according to Reuters.\nWhy startups need to be careful about export licenses and the Huawei ban\nReasons for the drawback are unclear. One answer might be the impact on American jobs. The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a tech industry-backed research group, argued in a new report today that export controls could cost up to $56.3 billion in damage to the U.S. economy and up to 74,000 jobs, depending on their scale. Obviously, the tech industry is mostly opposed to new tariffs or export controls, and the Trump administration has made American jobs a centerpiece of its domestic policy agenda.\nThe other answer might be that China is now fulminating against the actions and subtly threatening access to rare earth materials. President Xi Jinping toured a rare earths facility this weekend, in what was perceived by political analysts as a subtle reminder of China’s outsized role in rare earths exports, in which it is the world’s largest.\nRegardless, the new temporary reprieve won’t do much to change the underlying trade calculus, but it may afford Huawei a little breathing space to figure out what it should do next without U.S. technology.',
  "Google says its app store will continue to work for existing Huawei smartphone owners – TechCrunch\nGoogle says its app store will continue to work for existing Huawei smartphone owners\nManish Singh\n1 month\nGoogle\nsaid today that existing users of Huawei Android\ndevices can continue to use Google Play app store, offering some relief to tens of millions of users worldwide even as it remains unclear if the Chinese tech giant will be able to use the fully-functioning version of Android in its future phones.\nExisting Huawei phone users will also be able to enjoy security protections delivered through Google Play Protect, the company said in a statement to TechCrunch. Google Play Protect is a built-in malware detector that uses machine learning to detect and weed out rogue apps. Google did not specify whether Huawei devices will receive future Android updates.\nThe statement comes after Reuters reported on Sunday that Google is suspending some businesses with Huawei, the world’s second largest smartphone maker that shipped over 200 million handsets last year. The report claimed, a point not addressed by Google, that future Android devices from Huawei will not run Google Mobile Services, a host of services offered by Google including Google Play Store, and email client Gmail. A Huawei spokesperson said the company is looking into the situation but has nothing to share beyond this.\nFor Huawei users' questions regarding our steps to comply w/ the recent US government actions: We assure you while we are complying with all US gov't requirements, services like Google Play & security from Google Play Protect will keep functioning on your existing Huawei device.\n— Android (@Android) May 20, 2019\nIt’s a major setback for Huawei, which unless resolved in the next few weeks, could significantly disrupt its phone business outside of China. The top Android phone vendor, which is already grappling with controversy over security concerns, will have to rethink its software strategy for future phones if there is no resolution.\xa0Dearth — or delay in delivery — of future Android updates would also hurt the company’s reputation among its customers around the globe.\n“We are complying with the order and reviewing the implications,” a company spokesperson said in a statement.\nThe two tech companies find themselves in this awkward situation as a result of the latest development in the ongoing U.S-China trade war. Huawei and 70 of its affiliates have been put on an “entity list” by the\xa0U.S. Commerce Department over national security concerns, requiring local giants such as Google and Intel to take approval from the government before conducting business with the Chinese firm.\nHuawei may have already foreseen this.\xa0A company executive revealed recently that Huawei had built its own Android-based operating system in case a future event prevented it from using existing systems. Per Reuters, Huawei can also continue to use AOSP, the open source Android operating system that ships stripped off Google Mobile Services. And on paper, it can also probably have an app store of its own. But convincing enough stakeholders to make their apps available on Huawei’s store and continually push updates could prove incredibly challenging.",
  'GM’s car-sharing service Maven to exit eight cities – TechCrunch\nGM’s car-sharing service Maven to exit eight cities\nKirsten Korosec\n1 month\nGM is scaling back its Maven car-sharing company and will stop service in nearly half of the 17 North American cities in which it operates.\nA spokesperson who confirmed Maven was shutting down in some cities, without identifying the locations or number that will remain, said the company plans to focus on markets that have the strongest demand and growth potential.\nThe WSJ, which was the first to report the impending shutdown, said Maven will continue to operate in Detroit, Los Angeles, Washington, D.C. and Toronto. However, TechCrunch has received information from Maven customers that the car-sharing and peer-to-peer service in Washington, D.C. was also shutting down. The Maven Gig service will remain in Washington D.C.\nTechCrunch will update the article with more details about which markets Maven plans to exit.\nMaven’s car-sharing service is available in Ann Arbor, Mich., Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Detroit, Denver, Los Angeles, New York, Orlando, San Francisco and Washington, D.C. as well as Toronto, according to its website. Maven Gig, a service it launched in 2017 that rents out vehicles to rideshare and delivery drivers who use apps like Uber, Lyft and UberEATS, operates in Austin, Baltimore, Boston, Detroit, San Diego, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Phoenix, NYC and Washington, D.C.\nGM conducted a market-by-market analysis to determine which cities it would exit, according to the spokesperson.\nWhen Maven first launched in 2016 it helped bring (and expand) several of GM’s existing test programs under one brand. The mobility division initially launched as a car-sharing service akin to\xa0Zipcar.\nAt the time of its launch, Maven was essentially three car-sharing services in one that included a city-based service that rented GM vehicles by the hour through an app and another for urban apartment dwellers in Chicago and New York.\nA smartphone app, which is central to Maven’s business, is used by customers to search for and reserve a vehicle, unlock the door and remotely start, cool or heat the car.\nBut Maven has had its share of challenges. Demand was lackluster in some markets and the team tweaked, added or removed programs altogether in an effort to figure out what would work.\nMaven CEO Julia Steyn left GM in January. TechCrunch has also received tips from users complaining about the service and the platform — even being locked out of the vehicles in areas with limited cellular service.\nThe company launched in 2017 Maven Reserve in Los Angeles and San Francisco to allow customers to rent its GM-branded vehicles for a month at a time. It also started Maven Gig in hopes of tapping into a growing demand from rideshare and delivery app drivers.\nIn July, the automaker launched a service in Chicago, Detroit and Ann Arbor that let owners rent out their personal GM-branded vehicles through its Maven car-sharing platform. The peer-to-peer car rental service was designed to operate in a similar fashion to how Turo and Getaround work.\nThe creation of Maven was an important milestone for the automaker. GM Chairman and CEO Mary Barra used a study commissioned in the wake of the ignition switch engineering scandal to accelerate her plans to transform the culture and operations at the automaker. Dozens of executives participated in transformational leaders programs; Maven was one of the fruits that spun out of that.\nMaven was part of a wave of initiatives and investments announced by GM in early 2016 that illustrated its new interest in unconventional transportation that moved past the traditional core business of producing, selling and financing cars, trucks and SUVs to consumers.\nThat year, GM invested $500 million into ride-hailing startup Lyft, bought the remaining assets and tech of ride-hailing company Sidecar and, most famously, acquired self-driving car startup Cruise.\nMaven was notable because, unlike the other pursuits, this was its own commercial business.',
  'ZenHub Workspaces make GitHub easier to use across teams – TechCrunch\nZenHub Workspaces make GitHub easier to use across teams\nFrederic Lardinois\n@fredericl\n/\n1 month\nZenHub, a project management tool for GitHub, today announced the launch of Workspaces, a feature that makes it easier for teams to use its service — and GitHub\n— by allowing them to tweak the service to the needs of specific teams while still using GitHub as the ground truth for their work.\nWith Workspaces, teams can create multiple workspaces inside a GitHub repository (ZenHub\ndoes this through a Chrome extension) so that a team of developers can get a detailed view of every issue, for example, while other teams only get to see what is relevant to them. This also allows different teams to opt for their own work styles, no matter whether that’s Scrum or Kanban.\n“What this will allow teams to do is to work in their own unique ways and build their own unique workflows dependent on how they work,” ZenHub founder and CEO Aaron Upright told me. “So a front-end team can have its own board of GitHub issues, that’s more of a Kanban-style of workflow. And the back-end team can have its own workflow that’s more of a scrum style.”\nIssues are still shared across boards and every team can see what the other teams are working on, which will also allow for more transparency inside the company.',
  'Maisie Williams’ talent discovery startup Daisie raises $2.5 million, hits 100K members – TechCrunch\nMaisie Williams’ talent discovery startup Daisie raises $2.5 million, hits 100K members\nSarah Perez\n@sarahintampa\n/\n1 month\nMaisie Williams’\ntime on Game of Thrones may have come to an end, but her talent discovery app Daisie is just getting started. Co-founded by film producer Dom Santry, Daisie aims to make it easier for creators to showcase their work, discover projects and collaborate with one another through a social networking-style platform. Only 11 days after Daisie\nofficially launched to the public, the app hit an early milestone of 100,000 members. It also recently closed on $2.5 million in seed funding, the company tells TechCrunch.\nThe round was led by Founders Fund, which contributed $1.5 million. Other investors included 8VC, Kleiner Perkins, and newer VC firm Shrug Capital, from AngelList’s former head of marketing Niv Dror, who also separately invested. To date — including friends and family money and the founders’ own investment — Daisie has raised roughly $3 million.\nIt will later move toward raising a larger Series A, Santry says.\nOn Daisie, creators establish a profile as you would on a social network, find and follow other users, then seek out projects based on location, activity, or other factors.\n“Whether it’s film, music, photography, art — everything is optimized around looking for collaborators,” explains Santry. “So the projects that are actively open and looking for people to get involved, are the ones we’re really pushing for people to discover and hopefully get involved with,” he says.\nThe company’s goal to offer an alternative path to talent discovery is a timely one. Today, the creative industry is waking up — as are many others — to the ramifications of the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements. As power-hungry abusers lose their jobs, new ways of working, networking and sourcing talent are taking hold.\nAs Williams said when she first introduced the app last year, Daisie’s focus is on giving the power back to the creator.\n“Instead of [creators] having to market themselves to fit someone else’s idea of what their job would be, they can let their art speak for themselves,” she said at the time.\nThe app was launched into an invite-only beta on iOS last summer, and quickly saw a surge of users. After 37,000 downloads in week one, it crashed.\n“We realized that the community was a lot larger than the product we had built, and that scale was something we needed to do properly,” Santry tells TechCrunch.\nThe team realized there was another problem, too: Once collaborators found each other in Daisie, there wasn’t a clear cut way for them to get in touch with one another as the app had no communication tools or ways to share files built in.\n“That journey from concept to production was pretty muddy and quite muddled…so we realized, if we were bringing teams together, we actually wanted to give them a place to work — give them this creative hub…and take their project from concept all the way to production on Daisie,” Santry notes.\nWith this broader concept in mind, Daisie began fundraising in San Francisco shortly after the beta launch. The round initially closed in October 2018, but was more recently reopened to allow Dror’s investment.\nWith the additional funding in tow, Daisie has been able to grow its team of five to eighteen, including new hires from Monzo, Deliveroo, BBC, Microsoft, and others — specifically engineers who were familiar with designing apps for scale. Tasked with developing better infrastructure and a more expansive feature set, the team set to work on bringing Daisie to the web.\nNine months later, the new version launched to the public and is stable enough to handle the load. Today, it topped 100,000 users — most of which are in London. However, Daisie is planning to focus on taking its app to other cities including Berlin, New York, and L.A. going forward.\nThe company has monetization ideas in mind, but the app does not currently generate revenue. However, it’s already fielding inquiries from companies who want Daisie to find them the right talent for their projects.\n“We want the best for the creators on the platform, so if that means bringing clients on — and hopefully giving those connectivity opportunities — then we’ll absolutely [go] down those roads,” Santry says.\nThe app may also serve as a talent pipeline for Maisie Williams’ own Daisy Chain Productions. In fact, Daisie recently ran a campaign called London Creates which connected young, emerging creators with project teams, two of which were headed by Santry’s Daisy Chain Productions co-founders, Williams and Bill Milner.\nNow Daisy Chain Productions is going to produce a film from the Daisie collaboration as a result.\nWhile celebs sometimes do little more than lend their name to projects, Williams was hands-on in terms of getting Daisie off the ground, Santry says. During the first quarter of 2019, she worked on Daisie 9-to-5, he notes. But she has since started another film project and plans to continue to work as an actress, which will limit her day-to-day involvement. Her role now and in the future may be more high-level.\n“I think her role is going to become one of, culturally, like: where does Daisie stand? What do we stand for? Who do we work with? What do we represent?” he says. “How do we help creators everywhere? That’s mainly what Maisie wants to make sure Daisie does.”\n“I also think for her, Daisie is hoping to solve a problem that is really close to her heart,” he continues. “She had spent many years talking to people who asked her: ‘how do I make it? How do I get to where you are in the industry?’ And she really had no answer for that — no way to explain that her second audition ever was ‘Game of Thrones’ at the age of twelve,” Santry says. “So, I think this is really good opportunity [for her] to not only understand what it’s like to be part of a business, but also to have something that she really cares about, that she can carry through and take to wherever she goes,” he says.',

Commissioner Starks couldn’t say much about the proposed merger deal, but he had plenty to say regarding a host of other issues the FCC has the jurisdiction to chase.\nStarks was officially confirmed by the United States Senate at the beginning of the year to serve as an FCC commissioner in the Democratic minority. Starks has only been a commissioner for a few months, but he’s already faced tough policy questions. Should Chinese telecommunications companies be allowed to operate in US networks? How could the agency ensure that carriers like AT&T and Verizon aren’t selling customer location data to third parties where it could get in the hands of criminals and bounty hunters?\nStarks discussed these questions and more on this week’s interview episode of The Vergecast.\nBelow, is an excerpt of Starks discussing the national security and economic risks that come with allowing companies like Huawei access to US communications networks:\nLast week Brendan Carr, a Republican commissioner, called for national security agencies to investigate the Chinese telecommunications companies that are already operating on our networks. You seem to kind of agree with him on that.\nI do. Of course, this is all subject to getting, you know, DOJ and team telecom and the executive agency to weigh in on whether they see the same kind of national security concerns.\nBut yes, two weeks ago we did not allow [a license to operate within the US] for China Telecom. [Ed. note: Commissioner Starks misspoke. It’s actually China Mobile and not China Telecom that was denied, which we’ve reflected in transcript below.]\nMost critically, if [China Mobile] had been the lowest-cost carrier, they could have, in fact, carried some US government agency communications. The executive agency told us national security concerns that they have — which I agreed with — we’re not going to be able to allow them to operate in the US. So China Telecom and China Unicom are the two additional entities that Commissioner Carr had mentioned, and it sounds like the chairman is planning to bring those licenses before us, and I assume we would have the same standard that we would apply.\nSo you think it’s appropriate here. There are other lawmakers on Capitol Hill who are even calling Huawei a spy agency. You think this is an appropriate measure for the FCC to get involved with?\nI think it is extremely important. It is incumbent upon us. We have a distinct role to serve in protecting our communication networks under the defense of national security as well as the safety of life and property. I think it is extremely important for us to step in to the full extent of our authority.\nPrior to the ‘96 Communications Act, we very much had a network where there were a number of well-established carriers that trusted each other. It really was analogous to the feel of a small town where folks leave their doors open at night because there’s so much trust in the interconnections that happen there.\nObviously, now with technology, the neighborhood has grown. It’s more like a city now. And of course we have significantly more connections, more vulnerabilities. A significant number of carriers do have very good security mechanisms in place, but there are certainly actors out there that would take advantage of vulnerabilities, and the kind of wistful small town feel of a well-established network is more nostalgic now.\nBy 2025, there are going to be over 25 billion IoT devices that are connected to the network. We have to be focused and fit into our national security role.\nOver the weekend Google decided to revoke Huawei’s Android license. Is this kind of the role you see private industry playing?\nWell, that’s a little bit muddled.\nThey got named onto the blacklist by the Commerce secretary. We have seen within the last 24 hours that the Commerce secretary has kind of softened that a little bit because that is going to have such an impact on so many consumers that have Huawei devices. Are they going to get Android patches? Are they going to still be in the Android ecosystem? The reverberations are significant, and so just within the last 24 hours that has been tamped down a little bit. Although the executive order by the president does, over the long term, still stand.\nWhat Google is doing seems to get into a little bit more of kind of the Commerce lane of trade and whether we’re going to allow private actors to have agreements with Huawei and some of those other companies, but what I’m really focused on is making sure that we have a secure network as possible and that goes to these licenses with Chinese carriers.\nThis goes to the supply chain notice for proposed rule-making that we have before us, [which] essentially means the Universal Service Fund. It’s about a $9 or $10 billion fund that we administer at the FCC, [and the question is] whether that fund is going to allow government dollars to flow to some of these Chinese companies. That’s something that the FCC certainly has authority on.\nAnd then figuring out, how we can step into our national security lane even more. Something that I think we actually really need to be focused on is that there are a significant number of small rural carriers and we’re still figuring out the scope of this that actually do have some of this Chinese infrastructure in their network right now. And we need to find a way to, you know, find it, fix it, and I think fund the remediation aspect of that right.\nHow do we approach remediating that and changing the infrastructure?\nThat’s the question that I’m thinking through, that a lot of folks are starting to think through. I know a number of senators on the Hill are also very focused on this. The executive order, the National Defense Authorization Act also tells us that going forward, prospectively, we need to make sure that we’re not allowing some of this Huawei and Chinese infrastructure that could have backdoors and their software built into it.\nThat’s the question at the heart of this. Do you take it as a given that Huawei equipment has backdoors?\nI don’t take it as a given. I take it in the sense of having had national security folks who have specifically told me how they think about it, what our exposure is, what our risks are, and how seriously they take the possibility of backdoors in our network.\nObviously Huawei has lots of equipment in Europe, they’re saying “Look, we’re passing all the tests from America’s allies. Why don’t you trust us?”\nAnd this gets into the trade-off, and frankly how some of these small rural carriers have thought about this. Since 2012, 2013, and certainly in 2018, there have been clear unofficial warning shots that the US is growing more uncomfortable with allowing Huawei and ZTE to have their infrastructure here.\nWe allowed some of those small rural carriers to make the business decision themselves on where they were going to come out on Huawei being the cheapest, but the highest quality. Where were they on the spectrum of national security and privacy versus being the cheapest cost provider? Obviously, that’s a business decision.\nAnd that’s something they’ve told us. We’ve talked to lots of rural carriers and they say “Our costs are going to skyrocket now.” When you talk about equity, that’s a big piece of it.\nNow that we have the executive order that was issued just last week, I think it is something that I’m truly focused on right now.\nI’m focused on it. I have my team focused on it. We’re thinking through the scope of this problem, how much of this infrastructure is going to be at issue, how much is it going to cost. “Rip and replace” is what some of the national security folks call it.\nIt is a matter of getting, holistically, our head around that we know that we’re not allowed to bring this in prospectively, but retrospectively we know that we have some of this [infrastructure] in the ground. I think if the national security concern is there, we have to focus on that aspect of this as well.\nAnd that concern is there.\nIt’s very much there for me, and I know it is also a concern of a number of folks on the Hill. How are we going to remediate the national security infrastructure that we already have in our networks, in particular with some of these small rural carriers?\nWhat could what Huawei do to fix it? Is there a way for that company to get your trust back or the government’s trust back?\nThis is a whole-of-government issue. I am that decision-maker in a certain way, but I am not globally that decision-maker. My sense, as I sit here today, is that it is very tough to mitigate some of these vulnerabilities. When you’re talking about having this company potentially allowing a backdoor for potential Chinese spying. I think that’s very hard to mitigate.\nCorrection, May 22nd: Added inline notes to transcript to clarify that China Mobile was denied an operating license by the FCC, not China Telecom.\nThe Vergecast\nWeekly tech roundup and interviews with major figures from the tech world.\nSubscribe\nNext Up In\nPolicy\nGood Deals\nXbox One controllers, natively supported in iOS 13, are much cheaper today\nPlus, save on Logitech PC accessories and Samsung’s Galaxy S10 lineup\nThe Fujifilm X-T2 mirrorless camera body is cheaper than ever\nSave on the 2016 camera, the latest iPad Air, and more\nYou can still save $200 on a Samsung Galaxy S10E\nNew deals, plus a few Father’s Day offers that are still active\nGoogle’s loud Home Max speaker is $40 off for Verge readers\nA handful of exclusive deals for you\nThe Google Pixel 3 and 3 XL are $300 off at B&H Photo\nThe sale price is limited to 64GB, ‘not pink’ models\nMore in Good Deals\nVerge3.0_Logomark_Color_1\nSign up for the\nnewsletter\nCommand Line\nCommand Line delivers daily updates from the near-future.\nEmail (required)\nSubscribe\nBy signing up, you agree to our Privacy Policy and European users agree to the data transfer policy.\nThis Article has a component height of 40.

But according to Facebook’s chief AI scientist, Yann LeCun, AI is years away from being able to fully shoulder the burden of moderation, particularly when it comes to screening live video.\nSpeaking at an event at Facebook’s AI Research Lab in Paris last week, LeCun said Facebook was years away from using AI to moderate live video at scale, reports Bloomberg News.\n“This problem is very far from being solved,” said LeCun, who was recently awarded the Turing Prize, known as the Nobel Prize of computing, along with other AI luminaries.\nScreening live video is a particularly pressing issue at a time where terrorists commit atrocities with the aim of going viral. Facebook’s inability to meet this challenge became distressingly clear in the aftermath of the Christchurch shooting in New Zealand this year. The attack was streamed live on Facebook, and although the company claims it was seen by fewer than 200 people during its broadcast, it was this stream that was then downloaded and shared across the rest of the internet.\nAI can remove unwanted content, but only after a human has tagged it\nThe inability of automated systems to understand and block content like this isn’t news for AI experts like LeCun. They’ve long warned that machine learning just isn’t able to understand the variety and nuances of these videos. Automated systems are very good at removing content that has already been identified by humans as unwanted (Facebook says it automatically blocks 99 percent of terrorist content from al-Qaeda, for example), but spotting previously unseen examples is a much harder task.\nOne problem LeCun noted in Paris is the lack of training data. “Thankfully, we don’t have a lot of examples of real people shooting other people,” said the scientist. It’s possible to train systems to recognize violence using footage from movies, he added, but then content containing simulated violence would be inadvertently removed along with the real thing.\nInstead, companies like Facebook are focusing on using automated systems as assistants to human moderators. The AI flags troubling content, and humans manually vet it. Of course, the system of human moderation also has its own problems.\nBut remember: next time someone presents AI as a silver bullet for online moderation, the people who are actually building these systems know it’s a lot harder than that.\nNext Up In\nPolicy\nGood Deals\nXbox One controllers, natively supported in iOS 13, are much cheaper today\nPlus, save on Logitech PC accessories and Samsung’s Galaxy S10 lineup\nThe Fujifilm X-T2 mirrorless camera body is cheaper than ever\nSave on the 2016 camera, the latest iPad Air, and more\nMore in Good Deals\nVerge3.0_Logomark_Color_1\nSign up for the\nnewsletter\nCommand Line\nCommand Line delivers daily updates from the near-future.\nEmail (required)\nSubscribe\nBy signing up, you agree to our Privacy Policy and European users agree to the data transfer policy.\nThis Article has a component height of 10.

  'Several chip companies, including Qualcomm and Intel, have reportedly stopped supplying Huawei after blacklist – TechCrunch\nSeveral chip companies, including Qualcomm and Intel, have reportedly stopped supplying Huawei after blacklist\nCatherine Shu\n@catherineshu\n/\n1 month\nSeveral key suppliers are reportedly cutting off Huawei after the Trump administration added the Chinese telecom equipment and smartphone giant to a trade blacklist last week. According to Bloomberg, semiconductor companies Intel, Qualcomm, Xilinx and Broadcom will no longer supply Huawei until further notice. This follows another report earlier today that Google has suspended some trade with Huawei, leaving it with access only to the open-source version of Android.\nWhy startups need to be careful about export licenses and the Huawei ban\nIn addition to impacting Huawei’s business, the blacklisting has ramifications for telecom providers who are getting ready to launch 5G networks. In China, the three big telecoms (China Mobile,\nChina Unicom and China Telecom), which are all heavily reliant on Huawei, may be forced to delay 5G rollout. Meanwhile, U.S. carriers, especially smaller ones, may have to spend millions of dollars replacing Huawei equipment they have already installed or looking for new suppliers.\nIn tweet last week from the account Huawei Facts, the company called the blacklist a “lose-lose” situation. In a more recent tweet, it said “Oops! The U.S. is already coming to its senses over a ban on #Huawei, with a government official admitting that it cannot distance itself from the tech giant as easily as it might like. #HuaweiFacts” in response to a report that the administration might grant Huawei a temporary license to prevent service interruptions.\nOops! The U.S. is already coming to its senses over a ban on #Huawei, with a government official admitting that it cannot distance itself from the tech giant as easily as it might like. #HuaweiFacts https://t.co/qeiencw8ny\n— Huawei Facts (@HuaweiFacts) May 19, 2019\nMeanwhile, Google’s\nban, first reported by Reuters, would give Huawei, the second-largest smartphone brand in the world after Samsung, access only to open-source version of Android, leaving it with a significant disadvantage to other handset makers.\nAccording to Bloomberg, Huawei stockpiled three months worth of chips in anticipation of action by the U.S. government, which it has been at odds with since a 2012 Congressional report deemed it a potential threat to national security (accusations the company has repeatedly denied).\nA Xilinx\nspokesperson told TechCrunch “We are aware of the Denial Order issued by the U.S. Department of Commerce with respect to Huawei, and we are cooperating. We have no additional information to share at this time.” Huawei spokesperson said the company has no comment. TechCrunch has also contacted Broadcom, Qualcomm\nand Intel\nfor comment.\nUpdate: In a statement, a Huawei spokeperson said “Huawei has made substantial contributions to the development and growth of Android\naround the world. As one of Android’s key global partners, we have worked closely with their open-source platform to develop an ecosystem that has benefitted both users and the industry. Huawei will continue to provide security updates and after-sales services to all existing Huawei and Honor\nsmartphone and tablet products, covering those that have been sold and that are still in stock globally. We will continue to build a safe and sustainable software ecosystem, in order to provide the best experience for all users globally.”',
  'Investors just gave NFX $275 million more to fund seed-stage startups focused on ‘network effects’ – TechCrunch\nInvestors just gave NFX $275 million more to fund seed-stage startups focused on ‘network effects’\nConnie Loizos\n@Cookie\n/\n1 month\nIt’s the worst kept secret in the world of startup funding. Series A rounds today are the equivalent of what used to be called Series B rounds. The checks are bigger, but so are the expectations around revenue and traction.\nThat shift has created more of a vacuum for seed-stage companies. While there are plenty of individuals willing to plug money into nascent startups, and no shortage of micro VC funds focused on them, there is a dearth of funds with the kind of resources typically reserved for outfits that are picking up momentum. Think recruiting, HR, marketing, community building.\nYou might not think a budding company would need all of these pieces. But NFX,\na now four-year-old, San Francisco-based investment fund, argues that they do. And toward that end, it has persuaded investors — foundations, endowments and 50 individual investors — to provide it with $275 million in capital commitments for its second fund just one year after closing its debut fund with $150 million.\nThese investors seem to be buying into a number of things when it comes to NFX, which was originally founded as a kind of accelerator program for startups growing so-called network effects businesses. The idea, broadly, was that the more users a product has, the better the product becomes for future users.\nLast year, NFX decided to ditch the accelerator piece and restructure as a more traditional venture firm. But its focus on network effects still very much defines the firm, largely because its founders have all created businesses that have grown via network effects in their own careers. Its three general partners — James Currier, Pete Flint and Gigi Levy-Weiss — have been involved in the founding of the social network Tickle (sold to Monster.com in 2004), the home buyers’ site Trulia (which went public in 2012), the online travel site Lastminute.com (which sold to Sabre in 2005) and the social casino game publisher Playtika (acquired by a consortium in 2016).\nStan Chudnovsky, who co-founded NFX but is today an advisor (he’s a little busy as the head of Product for Messaging at Facebook), also helped build Tickle, as well as worked formerly as a top exec at PayPal.\nIndeed, in addition to helping “get everything in place” for seed-stage startups (the recruiting, the HR), NFX says it also works closely with the startups it funds to figure out their network effects.\nAs one example, the firm was among the earliest investors in Outdoorsy, a fast-growing platform that allows customers to book privately owned RVs and trucks. But Outdoorsy looked very different when it came to NFX. While it wanted to create a two-sided marketplace and co-founder Jeff Cavins, a serial entrepreneur, had already invested millions of dollars trying to figure it out, Outdoorsy was initially focused on the adventurers who would use the platform. NFX helped the company recognize that it was really a supply-side marketplace and that it should develop a SaaS product for the supply side of the market, meaning the RV owners. From there, says Currier, “We came up with a plan about what features to build and how to roll it out.”\nCurrier says that NFX similarly helped another of its portfolio companies, Mammoth Biosciences,\na two-year-old, San Francisco-based CRISPR-based platform for disease detection that looked dramatically different when its founders, Stanford PhD students, first met with NFX.\nThey had an interesting idea, to create a kind of platform that would ensure through DNA testing that fish being sold is what it’s being claimed to be (there’s a lot “imposter” fish being bought and sold every day).\nIt isn’t a huge market, though. NFX thought the team could go bigger, so the team met with NFX every week and they collectively decided over time to look at another technology, CRISPR, the technique that allows scientists to make precision edits to any DNA, but that also acts like a search engine for nucleic acids — which has many business applications.\nIn fact, with NFX’s help, the founders decided to go after diagnostics and therapeutics and to develop a kind a two-sided network by licensing key CRISPR intellectual property from UC Berkeley biotech labs like that of Dr. Jennifer Doudna. Before long, Doudna herself (widely known as a pioneer of CRISPR) came to like the idea so much that she co-founded Mammoth.\nSoon after, NFX co-led the company’s Series A round with the venture firm Mayfield. “We helped bring all that together,” says Currier.\nOf course, both Outdoorsy and Mammoth Biosciences are young companies. It’s too soon to know if they’ll scale up the way that NFX envisions they will. Still, they look like solid bets, as do some of the outfit’s other portfolio companies, including Ribbon, a startup that underwrites potential homebuyers using its own data system to predict whether a buyer will be eligible for a mortgage and for what amount. It gathered up $225 million in Series A equity and debt seven months ago.\nNFX was also among the earliest backers in Lyric,\na hospitality platform for business travelers that recently secured $160 million in equity and debt funding; Zeus, a startup that invites homeowners to rent space to business travelers (it just raised $24 million in March); and Firefly, a startup that allows rideshare drivers to make money through digital advertising (it closed a $21.5 million seed round in December).\nNo doubt, investors are also encouraged by the personal track records of Currier, Flint and Levy-Weiss, including their bets on Lyft, Patreon and Poshmark, among others. Flint tells us that over time, the team has invested in more than 300 startups altogether, across many sectors and numerous geographies.\nAs for how the new fund will be spent, the idea is to write initial checks of between $1.7 million and $2 million, with the occasional, bigger check reaching to upwards of $4 million or $5 million.\nMany of their bets are on U.S. companies, but because of Levy-Weiss, who is based in Israel, roughly one-third of the fund will be invested in Israeli founders, either living in Israel or in the U.S. (“Gigi is at the center of everything in Israel,” insists Currier.)\nThe firm will also continue working closely with startups — typically until they are 18 months old or, if it happens sooner, until the startups raise their Series B rounds. The idea is to meet with each of them every week for six months “to ensure they get the support they need,” says Flint. After a year-and-a-half, the partners step away to free themselves up for new commitments.\nIn the meantime, Currier, Flint and Levy-Weiss also plan to keep networking like mad, through brunches they’ve been hosting for years, dinners for their CEOs and founders and sector-specific summits, among other initiatives. While NFX prides itself on helping generate network effects for its startups, it very much believes its own chances of surviving and thriving rely on expanding its own network effects at all times. “It’s a lot of work,” says Currier with a smile, “but venture capital is a networks effects business, too.”',

It’s an “imagination-stirring” aspect of technology, one that has been part of stories and science-fiction for a long time. And now, Vlahos argues, it’s poised to change everything.\nVlahos is the author of Talk to Me: How Voice Computing Will Transform the Way We Live, Work, and Think (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt). It’s already the case that home assistants can talk and show personality — and as this technology develops, it’ll bring a host of questions that we haven’t reckoned with before.\nThe Verge spoke to Vlahos about the science of voice computing, which people will benefit most, and what this means for the power of Big Tech.\nThis interview has been lightly edited for clarity.\nWhat exactly is happening when you talk to a gadget like Alexa and it talks back?\nJames Vlahos\nPhoto: Barbara Butkus Photography.\nIf you’re just used to talking to Siri or Alexa and you say something and hear something back, it feels like one process is taking place. But you should really think about it as multiple things, each of which is complex to pull off.\nFirst, the sound waves of your voice have to be converted into words, so that’s automatic speech recognition, or ASR. Those words then have to be interpreted by the computer to figure out the meaning, and that’s NLU, or natural language understanding. If the meaning has been understood in some way, then the computer has to figure out something to say back, so that’s NLG, or natural language generation. Once this response has been formulated, there’s speech synthesis, so that’s taking words inside a computer and converting them back into sound.\nEach of these things is very difficult. It’s not as simple as the computer looking up a word in a dictionary and figuring things out. The computer has to get some things about how the world and people work to be able to respond.\nAre there any really exciting advances in this area that piqued your curiosity?\nThere’s a lot of really interesting work being done in natural language generation where neural networks are crafting original things for the computer to say. They’re not just grabbing prescripted words, they’re doing so after being trained on huge volumes of human speech — movie subtitles and Reddit threads and such. They’re learning the style of how people communicate and the types of things person B might say after person A. So, the computer being creative to a degree, that got my attention.\nWhat’s the ultimate goal of this? What will it look like when voice computing is ubiquitous?\nThe big opportunity is for the computers and phones that we’re using now to really fade in their primacy and importance in our technological lives, and for computers to sort of disappear. You have a need for information and want to get something done, you just speak and computers do your bidding.\nThat’s a huge shift. We’ve always been toolmakers and tool users. There are always things we hold or grab or touch or swipe. So when you imagine that all just fading away and your computing power is effectively invisible because we’re speaking to tiny embedded microphones in the environment that are connected to the cloud — that’s a profound shift.\nA second big one is that we are starting to have relationships with computers. People like their phones, but you don’t treat it as a person, per se. We’re in the era where we start to treat computers as beings. They exhibit emotions to a degree and they have personalities. They have dislikes, we look to them for companionship. These are new types of things you don’t expect from your toaster oven or microwave or smartphone.\nWho might benefit the most from the rise of voice assistants? The elderly is one group that we often hear about — especially because they can have poor eyesight and find it easier to talk. Who else?\nThe elderly and kids are really the guinea pigs for voice computing and personified AI. Elderly people have the issue often of being alone a lot, so they are the ones that might be more likely to turn to chitchat with Alexa. There are also applications out there where voice AI is used almost as a babysitter, giving medication reminders or letting family members do remote check-ins.\nThough, and not to way overgeneralize, some older people have dementia and it’s a little bit harder to recognize that the computer is not actually alive. Similarly, for kids, their grasp of reality is not so firm so they are arguably more willing to engage with these personified AIs as if they were really alive in some way. You also see the voice AIs being used as virtual babysitters, like, I’m not at home but the AI can watch out. That’s not totally happening yet, but it seems to be close to happening in some ways.\nWhat will happen when we get virtual babysitters and such and all the technology fades into the background?\nThe dark scenario is that we seek out human companionship less because we can turn to our digital friends instead. There’s already data pouring into Amazon that people are turning to Alexa for company and chat and small talk.\nBut you can spin that in a positive way and I sometimes do. It’s a good thing that we’re making machines more human-like. Like it or not, we spend a lot of time in front of our computer. If that interaction becomes more natural and less about pointing and clicking and swiping, then we’re moving in the direction of being more authentic and human, versus us having to make ourselves like quasi-machines as we interact with devices.\nAnd I think we’re going to hand more centralized authority to Big Tech. Especially when it comes to something like internet search, we are less likely to browse around, find the information we want, synthesize it, open magazines, open books, whatever it is we do to get information versus just asking questions of our voice AI oracles. It’s really convenient to be able to do that, but also we give even greater trust and authority to a company like Google to tell us what is true.\nHow different is that scenario from the current worry about “fake news” and misinformation?\nWith voice assistants, it’s not practical or desirable for them to, when you ask them a question, give you the verbal equivalent of 10 blue links. So Google has to choose which answer to give you. Right there, they’re getting enormous gatekeeper power to select what information is presented, and history has shown that if you consolidate the control of information very highly in a single entity’s hands, that’s rarely good for democracy.\nRight now, the conversation is very centered on fake news. With voice assistants, we’re going to skew in a different direction. Google’s going to have to really focus on not presenting [fake news]. If you’re only presenting one answer, it better not be junk. I think the conversation is going to more turn toward censorship. Why do they get to choose what is deemed to be fact?\nHow much should we worry about privacy and the types of analyses that can be done with voice?\nI am equally worried about privacy implications as I am with just smartphones in general. If tech companies are abusing that access to my home, they can do it equally with my computer as they can do it with Alexa sitting across the room,\nThat’s not at all to play down privacy concerns. I think they’re very, very real. I think it’s unfair to single out voice devices as being worse. Though there is the sense that we’re using them in different settings, in the kitchen and living room.\nSwitching topics a little bit, your book spends some time discussing the personalities of various voice assistants. How important is it to companies that their products have personality?\nPersonality is important. That’s definitely key, otherwise why do voice at all? If you want pure efficiency, you might be better off with a phone or desktop. What hasn’t happened heavily yet is differentiation around the edges between Cortana, Alexa, Siri. We’re not seeing tech companies design vastly different personalities with an idea toward capturing different slices of the market. They’re not doing what cable television or Netflix do where you have all these different shows that are slicing and dicing the consumer landscape.\n“The big opportunity is for the computers and phones that we’re using now to really fade in their primacy and importance in our technological lives and for computers to sort of disappear.”\nMy prediction is that we will do that in the future. Right now, Google and Amazon and Apple just want to be liked by the most number of people so they’re going pretty broad, but [I think they will develop] the technology so my assistant is not the same as your assistant is not the same as your co-worker’s assistant. I think they’ll do that because it would be appealing. With every other product in our lives we don’t have a one-size-fits-all, so I don’t see why we would do that with voice assistants.\nThere’s some trickiness there, though, as we see in discussions around why assistants tend to have female voices. Is more of that in store?\nWe’re seeing questions already about issues relating to gender. There’s been very little conversation about the issue of race or perceived race of virtual assistants, but I have a sense that that conversation is coming. It’s funny. When you press the big tech companies on this issue, except for Amazon who admits Alexa is female, everyone else is like “it’s an AI, it doesn’t have a gender.” That’s not going to stop people from perceiving clues about what sort of gender or race identity it’s going to have.\nAll this to say, Big Tech is going to have to be really careful to negotiate those waters. They might want to specialize a little more, but they might get into dangerous waters where they do something that sounds like cultural appropriation, or something that is just off, or stereotypical.\nNext Up In\nScience\nGood Deals\nXbox One controllers, natively supported in iOS 13, are much cheaper today\nPlus, save on Logitech PC accessories and Samsung’s Galaxy S10 lineup\nThe Fujifilm X-T2 mirrorless camera body is cheaper than ever\nSave on the 2016 camera, the latest iPad Air, and more\nYou can still save $200 on a Samsung Galaxy S10E\nNew deals, plus a few Father’s Day offers that are still active\nGoogle’s loud Home Max speaker is $40 off for Verge readers\nA handful of exclusive deals for you\nThe Google Pixel 3 and 3 XL are $300 off at B&H Photo\nThe sale price is limited to 64GB, ‘not pink’ models\nMore in Good Deals\nVerge3.0_Logomark_Color_1\nSign up for the\nnewsletter\nCommand Line\nCommand Line delivers daily updates from the near-future.\nEmail (required)\nSubscribe\nBy signing up, you agree to our Privacy Policy and European users agree to the data transfer policy.\nThis Article has a component height of 44.

  'Lyft adds more safety features, including in-app emergency assistance, reminders to check the plate – TechCrunch\nLyft adds more safety features, including in-app emergency assistance, reminders to check the plate\nSarah Perez\n@sarahintampa\n/\n1 month\nEarlier this spring, both Uber and Lyft introduced new safety features and policies following the death of a university student who was kidnapped and murdered after getting into a vehicle she believed to be her Uber ride. Today, Lyft is announcing an expanded set of safety features and programs, including those that help riders find and identify their ride, alert emergency services if they believe they are in danger and communicate ride issues back to Lyft support and drivers.\nIt’s also introducing a new driver and rider education program.\nIn April, Lyft had begun the process of making its app and service safer with the\xa0implementation of continuous background checks for drivers — something Uber has had in place since 2018. It also said it was enhancing its identity verification process for drivers to prevent driver identity fraud on its platform.\nUber, meanwhile, had last month introduced new system banners and alerts to remind users to check their ride details — like the license plate, car make and model, as well as the driver’s name and photo. It had previously rolled out its own slate of safety features a year ago, which included its in-app Safety Center and an “Emergency” button.\nToday, Lyft\nis catching up with the announcement of a similar feature set.\nIn the weeks ahead, Lyft says it, too, will roll out an in-app feature that provides for riders access to 911 from within its app. (Drivers already had this feature in their own app, Lyft notes.)\nLike Uber, Lyft is also redesigning its app to better highlight the ride details — and specifically, making it easier to see the license plate number. When the car arrives, the driver photo, car photo and license plate appear in a pop-up in the app, alongside a reminder to match the plate to the one on the vehicle.\nSome riders may have already seen this change, but it will now roll out to the remaining user base, says Lyft.\nThe company is also introducing mandatory feedback that will require riders to explain when a driver receives less than four stars.\nThis feedback is shared anonymously with the driver in a single location in their app, Lyft says. However, this change may not resolve issues with drivers who behave poorly because many people are uncomfortable leaving feedback when they felt unsafe. Riders, and especially women, often believe the driver would figure out that it’s them, even if it’s anonymous. Plus, if the driver has picked them up from their home, office or another place they frequent, they may feel even less comfortable leaving a review since the driver literally knows where to find them.\nFinally, Lyft says it will make sexual harassment prevention education available to all Lyft drivers and riders this year, but didn’t share the details as to how these materials will be rolled out.\nThe new features join Lyft’s existing line-up of features, programs and policies focused on safety, like its background checks on drivers, in-app photos of drivers and vehicles, real-time ride tracking, digital receipts and two-way rating systems — the majority of which are common to ride-hailing apps.\nThe company says it expects to expand its efforts in this space over the course of the year and in the future.\nThe changes arrive soon after both Uber and Lyft saw their IPOs perform poorly, a result of investor concerns around slowing growth, mounting losses, increased global competition and numerous other factors. Adding to that the fact that their apps may not be safe enough in their present state could have been another big ding against both businesses, had the companies not addressed the problem.',
  'Apple announces new MacBook Pros with a keyboard fix, oh, and more powerful processors – TechCrunch\nApple announces new MacBook Pros with a keyboard fix, oh, and more powerful processors\nMatthew Panzarino\n@Panzer\n/\n1 month\nApple\nis updating its 15” MacBook Pro with new 8-core and 6-core processors and its 13” MacBook Pro with Touch Bar with 8th-gen quad-core processors. Apple says that these boosts mean the 15” MacBook Pro\xa0will run at double the speed of the previous quad-core models and hit 40% improvements over the 6-core MacBook Pro model.\nApple says this is its fastest Mac notebook ever.\nOh, and there is that keyboard update.\nSpeed bump\nThe $2,399 config of the 15″ MacBook Pro is getting a 2.6GHz 6-core i7 that boosts to 4.5ghz, a 400 MHz increase in turbo speed. The top end $2,799 config is now standard with an 8-core i9, two more cores and a 500 MHz increase over the current 6-core config.\nThe 13″ MacBook Pro with Touch Bar gets boosted 2.4GHz quad-core processors, standard, which will turbo boost to speeds up to 4.7GHz. The configure-your-own option gets a 200MHz bump, making it a full 2x faster from the dual-core 13”.\nThe speed boosts of the MacBook Pro and the keyboard changes come after a year of boosts for the flagship notebook. It got an update last July, a graphics update in October and now the i9 update. Amidst a shift in Apple’s business driven by smartphone market saturation, the Mac has continued to grow out-sized to the industry and still acts as a beachhead for Apple in many enterprise businesses.\nThe new MacBook Pro models will be available for purchase today.\nAbout the keyboard\nApple also told me that it is making three announcements about the MacBook Pro keyboard situation. Unless you’ve been under a rock, you’re aware that the current generation of MacBook Pro (and MacBook Air) models have had issues with keys either not firing or firing twice, resulting in no letter or double letters typed. The industry term for this is “make or double make.”\nApple recently revised the MacBook keyboards quietly with the addition of a membrane that seemed intended to prevent dust and particulates from making it under the keys and preventing firing. The updates, though seemingly improvements, still resulted in some malfunctions. And, Apple never really even said they were making the change.\nToday, however, they told me they’re taking three explicit steps to help with the keyboard situation:\nThe MacBook Pro keyboard mechanism has had a materials change in the mechanism. Apple says that this new keyboard mechanism composition will substantially reduce the double-type/no-type issue. Apple will not specify what it has done, but doubtless tear-downs of the keyboard will reveal what has been updated.\nThough Apple believes this change will greatly reduce the issue, it is also including all butterfly keyboards across its notebook line in its Keyboard Service Program. This means that current MacBook Pros and even the models being released today will have keyboard repairs covered at no cost, in warranty and out of warranty.\nApple tells me that repair times for keyboards have been longer than they would like. It is making substantial improvements to repair processes in Apple Stores to make repairs faster for customers with issues.\nIf you bring a MacBook in with an older third-generation (the one with the membrane) malfunctioning keyboard, it will be replaced with this new fourth revision of the MacBook keyboard. So if you have an Air or a Pro that has issues, it will get the new mechanism.\nAs a note, the changes in the keyboards are “under the hood,” meaning they are not intended to change the look or feel of the keyboard and should result in the same typing experience as current-gen keyboards.\nThe popularity of the MacBook Pro has only been highlighted by the keyboard issues, as no one notices a flaw in their tools more than people who live and die by them. If Apple is able to finally put the issues of this current generation of keyboards to rest it will have plugged a potential hole in MacBook sales and given itself breathing room to introduce a full new generation of the machines.\nThis speed bump comes in advance of Apple’s WWDC conference where it is anticipated to launch iOS 13 and other software products for consumers and developers. Apple has, at times, used the stage to announce hardware improvements as well. Its decision to announce this speed bump and keyboard fix now could be a result of its desire to “clear the decks” for announcements onstage at the conference, or a desire to address the keyboard fix “off air” — or both.\nWWDC is about a week and a bit away, and we’ll be there on the ground to bring you the updates from the scene.',

One fan in a New York bar has a theory he’s happy to share: Varys has been slowly poisoning her. “That’s why she looks so terrible,” Michael says of Daenerys in the penultimate episode, referring to a scene in which she looks exhausted and unwashed. “[This poison] makes you go crazy and violent before you’ve had the final dose,” he adds. “So the fan theory is that he succeeded in poisoning her part-way.” Thus, her genocidal spree.\nMichael isn’t sure he’s bought into the idea entirely, but all is about to be revealed. Dozens of fans have gathered to watch the final episode of Game of Thrones on a dimly lit patio in north Brooklyn. It’s pleasantly warm, which means an errant mosquito or two. Noise from a nearby air conditioner makes the rise and fall of a dramatic music cue impossible to hear.\nAnd then there’s the maddening, unpredictable nature of bar Wi-Fi, which is still buffering 10 minutes past the show’s start time. Fifteen minutes late, after a long period of a pinwheeling “wait” icon and frozen on-screen faces, the show starts, but the volume is frustratingly low. The episode’s first lines are overwhelmed by viewers yelling for subtitles no one can figure out how to turn on. “Is there a doctor in the house?” someone quips. Another 10 minutes passes while heroic patrons step up to do tech support.\na $7 beer is a more palatable price of admission than a monthly HBO subscription\nThe group experience can be a lot of work, and it involves frustrated waiting to see a program we could all be watching from the comforts of home. But there is emotional strength in numbers, a need to turn to the person next to you in open-mouthed disbelief, as if to say, “Are you seeing this?” A show where a pregnant woman once got shanked in the stomach like it was a prison showdown — not even the worst thing to happen on Game of Thrones — demands to be watched with other people. And a $7 beer is a more palatable price of admission than a monthly HBO subscription you’re “borrowing” from a friend of a friend.\nThe nearly decade-long saga captured the public eye in an unprecedented way. It’s easy to shock people by admitting you don’t watch the dragon fantasy show. Game of Thrones fans are so engaged with live-tweeting that they laugh in the face of online spoiler culture, a force so powerful companies like Marvel have established spoiler warnings before trailers. A million ding-dongs are clamoring for HBO to remake one of the most expensive shows in TV history.\nGame of Thrones even has its own sort of YouTube react genre, where cameras capture some of the show’s most shocking moments from people watching at home and together in bars. Game of Thrones is already being hailed as “the last show” we’ll watch together — a premature title that assumes we’re all marching toward the death of prestige television, social media, and the shared experience. Instead, it’s safer to say we’ve just lived through the blueprint for how the internet has changed the way we consume media. Game of Thrones changed how a TV show could be a modern social experience.\nAt least, that’s how some fans used to see it. Game of Thrones now? “It sucks,” says Andres, a fan of George R.R. Martin’s books who says he’s waited 15 years to see how this story will end. Tempered expectations is the vibe at the bar, where many viewers say they’ve been let down by the breakneck pace of the last two seasons. It’s not that the show has gone places they don’t want, but rather that it’s been done so clumsily. These fans aren’t mad; they’re just disappointed.\nTonight, Andres is here to down a few beers with a buddy and usher the show off into the sunset. He loves the experience of watching it in public, where “a lot of people share the same thing you like.” But his hopes aren’t as high as they used to be. “It just became a regular TV show,” he says. “You already know what to expect.” And indeed, the predictions Andres makes about Jon and Daenerys are exactly how their story plays out.\nAnother fan, Melissa Lugo, expresses equal disappointment with the show’s season. She’s tuned in over the years for what she calls a great story, one that pulled her in completely and sent her down many internet rabbit holes, following fan theories. “It takes you away,” she says. “It’s such an escape.”\nThe bar adds $20 to your tab if you spoil an episode\nThe bar has strict rules about its watch parties. Loud attendees get enthusiastically shushed by rapt viewers. The bar adds $20 to your tab if you spoil an episode for people inside who haven’t seen it. As the episode plays out, it’s so quiet, you can hear a pin drop — or, more accurately, a glass shatter. Someone’s beer has just flunked the “What do we say to the god of death?” test, but viewers are so engrossed with the drama on the screen that no one even flinches. It’s a quieter crowd than most bar reaction videos might lead you to believe.\nBut it’s still a unique slice of a shared experience. A murmur ripples through the crowd as Dany’s fate is revealed. Tyrion’s jokes land well, though Sansa gets the biggest laugh of the night with a simple “Sit down” aimed at her overambitious uncle. People cheer when Jon finally gives poor, one-eared Ghost a pat, and express mixed emotions over the new ruler of the seven — err, six — kingdoms. They process it together, as they experience it together.\nWhen the final credits roll, a few patrons remain seated, picking over which theories proved correct. HBO may have big plans for the show’s universe, but Game of Thrones is over. Love or hate that finale, it’s the end of eight seasons of twists, tears, and a lot of fire and blood. “The cliché would be that it’s a bittersweet ending,” says Yusuf Razzaque, who’s watched the show from four different countries. It’s been a great adventure to have experienced during its TV run, but he’s content to let it end. “In five, 10 years from now, we can watch this again,” he says. What is dead may never die, especially with a streaming subscription.\nMore From\nThe Verge\nGood Deals\nXbox One controllers, natively supported in iOS 13, are much cheaper today\nPlus, save on Logitech PC accessories and Samsung’s Galaxy S10 lineup\nThe Fujifilm X-T2 mirrorless camera body is cheaper than ever\nSave on the 2016 camera, the latest iPad Air, and more\nYou can still save $200 on a Samsung Galaxy S10E\nNew deals, plus a few Father’s Day offers that are still active\nGoogle’s loud Home Max speaker is $40 off for Verge readers\nA handful of exclusive deals for you\nThe Google Pixel 3 and 3 XL are $300 off at B&H Photo\nThe sale price is limited to 64GB, ‘not pink’ models\nMore in Good Deals\nVerge3.0_Logomark_Color_1\nSign up for the\nnewsletter\nCommand Line\nCommand Line delivers daily updates from the near-future.\nEmail (required)\nSubscribe\nBy signing up, you agree to our Privacy Policy and European users agree to the data transfer policy.\nThis Article has a component height of 19.

  'Mid-range flagships like the Honor 20 Pro are giving premium phones a run for their money – TechCrunch\nMid-range flagships like the Honor 20 Pro are giving premium phones a run for their money\nBrian Heater\n@bheater\n/\n1 month\nPhone sales have been trending downward for some time now. There are a number of reasons for this — many of which you can read about in this piece I published last week. The creeping cost of premium handsets is pretty high on that list, with flagships now routinely topping $1,000 from many of the big names.\nThe big smartphone makers have begun to react to this, with budget flagship alternatives like the iPhone XR, Galaxy S10e and Pixel 3a. A new crop of mid-range flagships, however, are giving them a run for their money and serving as an important reminder that a quality handset doesn’t need to be priced in the four digits.\nThe Honor\n20 Pro fits nicely in the latter camp, joining the likes of the recently announced OnePlus 7 Pro and Asus ZenFone 6 in demonstrating that premium specs can still be had for what was once considered a reasonable flagship price.\nOf course, before we get into specifics of pricing with the newly announced handset, it bears mentioning whether Honor, a brand owned by Huawei, will actually ever make it to the States. That’s all pretty complicated — like Donald Trump in a trade war with with China complicated. The pricing on the London-launched Pro version is €599, putting it at around $670.\nThe phone’s got Huawei’s latest and greatest Kirin 980 processor, coupled with a 6.26-inch display with hole-punch cutout and a quartet of rear-facing cameras. Those include a wide angle with 117-degree shots, 48-megapixel main, telephoto and a macro, which is an interesting addition to the standard array. The Pro’s out at some point in the June or July time frame.\nHuawei bans aside, it will be interesting to see how this new crop of more affordable premium devices impacts the rest of the big names up top.',
  'Google says some G Suite user passwords were stored in plaintext since 2005 – TechCrunch\nGoogle says some G Suite user passwords were stored in plaintext since 2005\nZack Whittaker\n@zackwhittaker\n/\n1 month\nGoogle says a small number of its enterprise customers mistakenly had their passwords stored on its systems in plaintext.\nThe search giant disclosed the exposure Tuesday but declined to say exactly how many enterprise customers were affected. “We recently notified a subset of our enterprise G Suite customers that some passwords were stored in our encrypted internal systems unhashed,” said Google vice president of engineering Suzanne Frey.\nPasswords are typically scrambled using a hashing algorithm to prevent them from being read by humans. G Suite administrators are able to manually upload, set and recover new user passwords for company users, which helps in situations where new employees are on-boarded. But Google said it discovered in April that the way it implemented password setting and recovery for its enterprise offering in 2005 was faulty and improperly stored a copy of the password in plaintext.\nGoogle has since removed the feature.\nNo consumer Gmail accounts were affected by the security lapse, said Frey.\n“To be clear, these passwords remained in our secure encrypted infrastructure,” said Frey. “This issue has been fixed and we have seen no evidence of improper access to or misuse of the affected passwords.”\nGoogle has more than 5 million enterprise customers using G Suite.\nGoogle said it also discovered a second security lapse earlier this month as it was troubleshooting new G Suite customer sign-ups. The company said since January it was improperly storing “a subset” of unhashed G Suite passwords on its internal systems for up to two weeks. Those systems, Google said, were only accessible to a limited number of authorized Google staff, the company said.\n“This issue has been fixed and, again, we have seen no evidence of improper access to or misuse of the affected passwords,” said Frey.\nGoogle said it’s notified G Suite administrators to warn of the password security lapse, and will reset account passwords for those who have yet to change.\nA spokesperson confirmed Google has informed data protection regulators of the exposure.\nGoogle becomes the latest company to have admitted storing sensitive data in plaintext in the past year. Facebook said in March that “hundreds of millions” of Facebook and Instagram passwords were stored in plaintext. Twitter and GitHub also admitted similar security lapses last year.\nRead more:\nResearchers find 540 million Facebook user records on exposed servers\nFacebook now says its password leak affected ‘millions’ of Instagram users\nA leaky database of SMS text messages exposed password resets and two-factor codes\nA hotspot finder app exposed 2 million Wi-Fi network passwords\nYou should change your Twitter password right now\nA family tracking app was leaking real-time location data',
  'Sofar Sounds house concerts raises $25M, but bands get just $100 – TechCrunch\nSofar Sounds house concerts raises $25M, but bands get just $100\nJosh Constine\n@JoshConstine\n/\n1 month\nTired of noisy music venues where you can hardly see the stage? Sofar Sounds\nputs on concerts in people’s living rooms where fans pay $15 to $30 to sit silently on the floor and truly listen. Nearly 1 million guests have attended Sofar’s more than 20,000 gigs. Having attended a half dozen of the shows, I can say they’re blissful… unless you’re a musician trying to make a living. In some cases, Sofar pays just $100 per band for a 25 minute set, which can work out to just $8 per musician per hour or less. Hosts get nothing, and Sofar keeps the rest, which can range from $1,100 to $1,600 or more per gig — many times what each performer takes home. The argument was that bands got exposure, and it was a tiny startup far from profitability.\nToday, Sofar Sounds announced it’s raised a $25 million round led by Battery Ventures and Union Square Ventures, building on the previous $6 million it’d scored from Octopus Ventures and Virgin Group. The goal is expansion — to become the de facto way emerging artists play outside of traditional venues. The 10-year-old startup was born in London out of frustration with pub-goers talking over the bands. Now it’s throwing 600 shows per month across 430 cities around the world, and more than 40 of the 25,000 artists who’ve played its gigs have gone on to be nominated for or win Grammys. The startup has enriched culture by offering an alternative to late-night, dark and dirty club shows that don’t appeal to hard-working professionals or older listeners.\nBut it’s also entrenching a long-standing problem: the underpayment of musicians. With streaming replacing higher-priced CDs, musicians depend on live performances to earn a living. Sofar is now institutionalizing that they should be paid less than what gas and dinner costs a band. And if Sofar sucks in attendees that might otherwise attend normal venues or independently organized house shows, it could make it tougher for artists to get paid enough there too. That doesn’t seem fair, given how small Sofar’s overhead is.\nBy comparison, Sofar makes Uber look downright generous. A source who’s worked with Sofar tells me the company keeps a lean team of full-time employees who focus on reserving venues, booking artists and promotion. All the volunteers who actually put on the shows aren’t paid, and neither are the venue hosts, though at least Sofar pays for insurance. The startup has previously declined to pay first-time Sofar performers, instead providing them a “high-quality” video recording of their gig. When it does pay $100 per act, that often amounts to a tiny shred of the total ticket sales.\n“Sofar, however, seems to be just fine with leaving out the most integral part: paying the musicians,” writes musician Joshua McClain. “This is where they willingly step onto the same stage as companies like Uber or Lyft\u200a—\u200asavvy middle-men tech start-ups, with powerful marketing muscle, not-so-delicately wedging themselves in-between the customer and merchant (audience and musician in this case). In this model, everything but the service-provider is put first: growth, profitability, share-holders, marketers, convenience, and audience members\u200a—\u200aall at the cost of the hardworking people that actually provide the service.” He’s urged people to #BoycottSofarSounds\nA deeply reported KQED expose by Emma Silvers found many bands were disappointed with the payouts, and didn’t even know Sofar was a for-profit company. “I think they talk a lot about supporting local artists, but what they’re actually doing is perpetuating the idea that it’s okay for musicians to get paid shit,” Oakland singer-songwriter Madeline Kenney told KQED.\nSofar CEO Jim Lucchese, who previously ran Spotify’s Creator division after selling it his music data startup The Echo Nest, and has played Sofar shows himself, declares that “$100 for a showcase slot is definitely fair,” but admits that “I don’t think playing a Sofar right now is the right move for every type of artist.” He stresses that some Sofar shows, especially in international markets, are pay-what-you-want and artists keep “the majority of the money.” The rare sponsored shows with outside corporate funding like one for the Bohemian Rhapsody film premiere can see artists earn up to $1,500, but these are a tiny fraction of Sofar’s concerts.\nOtherwise, Lucchese says, “the ability to convert fans is one of the most magical things about Sofar,” referencing how artists rely on asking attendees to buy their merchandise or tickets for their full shows and follow them on social media to earn money. He claims that if you pull out what Sofar pays for venue insurance, performing rights organizations and its full-time labor, “a little over half the take goes to the artists.” Unfortunately that makes it sound like Sofar’s few costs of operation are the musicians’ concern. As McClain wrote, “First off, your profitability isn’t my problem.”\nNow that it has ample funding, I hope to see Sofar double down on paying artists a fair rate for their time and expenses. Luckily, Lucchese says that’s part of the plan for the funding. Beyond building tools to help local teams organize more shows to meet rampant demand, he says “Am I satisfied that this is the only revenue we make artists right now? Absolutely not. We want to invest more on the artist side.” That includes better ways for bands to connect with attendees and turn them into monetizable fans. Even just a better followup email with Instagram handles and upcoming tour dates could help.\nWe don’t expect most craftspeople to work for “exposure.” Interjecting a middleman like Sofar shouldn’t change that. The company has a chance to increase live music listening worldwide. But it must treat artists as partners, not just some raw material they can burn through even if there’s always another act desperate for attention. Otherwise musicians and the empathetic fans who follow them might leave Sofar’s living rooms empty.',
  'What will save crypto? – TechCrunch\nWhat will save crypto?\nSulaiman al-Fahim\n1 month\nSulaiman al-Fahim\nContributor\nSulaiman al-Fahim is an international businessman based in Dubai with focuses on property management/real estate, cryptocurrency, and philanthropy. His company, Sulaiman Al-Fahim Holdings, is a global operator that facilitates transactions to develop properties in various areas of the world. He is also an advisor and partner at ADAB Solutions, a group dedicated to bringing the newest movement in financial tech to the Muslim world.\nCryptocurrency technology has been on a tumultuous journey since its creation in 2009. According to a recent New York Times article, bitcoin enthusiasts in the U.S. wrongly predicted the involvement of Wall Street institutions and investors in cryptocurrency, which would have given it legitimacy. Instead, the opposite effect has taken place: big investors have avoided crypto because of its volatility, as shown by bitcoin’s devastating drop in price\xa0last year.\nElsewhere in the world, particularly in the Middle East and among major Muslim communities, there is a growing curiosity surrounding cryptocurrency — and a call for regulation that deals with the stigmas against it. There are about 1.8 billion Muslims worldwide, and the global Islamic economy with the inclusion of crypto tools, services and products could equate to approximately US$3 trillion by 2021. If we are able to work through the challenges and implement crypto for a Muslim audience, the addressable market for crypto could increase exponentially.\nBut since its inception, Muslim leaders and communities have debated on whether or not cryptocurrencies should be deemed halal or\xa0haram, permissible or forbidden. Shariah-compliant finance is a fundamental part of Islamic tradition, and it’s the primary reason why Islamic countries have been so dubious of the new currency.\nThe challenge of Shariah compliance\nShariah compliance refers to finances and investments that adhere to Islamic law. This includes prohibiting riba, or charged interest, and avoiding any “unethical concerns,” such as maisir\xa0(gambling), alcohol and tobacco production, weaponry and more. It also prohibits qimar, or investments based on speculation. Crypto’s proven volatility has been likened to gambling and speculation, a critical reason behind the debate of\xa0halal\xa0and\xa0haram. Countries like Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Jordan\xa0have outright banned cryptos, and the concern over the legitimacy of crypto has thus far prevented the Middle East from truly embracing the technology.\nBut for those paying attention, the attitude around cryptocurrency in the Middle East has begun to shift in the past year. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has led the charge in nurturing an acceptance of cryptocurrency in the region, and launched a strategy that aims for 50% of all government transactions to occur through blockchain. The first cryptocurrency exchange in UAE, the Cryptobulls Exchange, opened last year and gained more than 200,000 traders. Ripple, a top global blockchain platform, has plans to set up an office in Dubai, and is working with UAE Exchange, the country’s largest remittance firm, to set up blockchain-based payments to Asia.\nHow companies and institutions are approaching compliance\nIn addition, the development of Shariah-compliant crypto and blockchain services is beginning to weave a new narrative, an essential one that reconciles and compromises with the tenets of Islamic tradition. In mid-2018, cryptocurrency and finance platform Stellar was permitted to integrate and service financial institutions in the Middle East by The Shariyah Review Bureau (SRB), a leading international advisory agency licensed by the Central Bank of Bahrain, as a result of its compliance to Shariah law in its practices. X8 AG, a Swiss-based startup well known for its fiat-backed crypto, also received certification from the SRB, demonstrating that fiat-supported currencies are more appealing to Islamic countries.\nEven more recently, 2019 has already seen the launch of meem, Bahrain’s first fully digital bank, and the first Shariah-compliant digital bank in the region. It will also see the launch of Qintar, the first crypto token expressly made to be Shariah-compliant. It will be built on their Islamic Blockchain (ISL), which has received\xa0fatwa\xa0(a non-binding legal opinion) of approval from Islamic scholars and researchers. The ISL is secured and speedy with full transparency, allowing users to safely control their own trades and ensure that their transactions follow restrictions like\xa0riba\xa0or\xa0maisir.\nShariah compliance has hit the ground running\nThese swift, sweeping movements toward Shariah compliance in the past few years are paving the way for a wider adoption of the technology, as well as an increased mindfulness and inclusion of the way business is conducted in different cultures. The establishment of new institutions that all play a part in a Shariah-compliant crypto ecosystem, such as banks and exchanges, help build up a regulated foundation that can keep cryptocurrency stable and provide a vetting process for which projects will be deemed halal or haram.\nAnd of course, the development and counsel of Shariah advisory boards in various forms not only lend legitimacy, but keep companies accountable in enforcing these rules. Approval from Islamic scholars and experts will also work to lift the stigmas of cryptocurrency in the region and the culture.\nIt is evident that cryptocurrency and blockchain are beginning to earn the favor of Islamic countries. It is also clear that the necessary steps are already being made in order to make blockchain and crypto Shariah-compliant, as well as increasing acceptance of the new fintech among Muslim people.\nThe nearly two billion Muslims in the world represent a significant 23% of the total population, and by including them in crypto ventures through Shariah-compliant regulation, we can see crypto finally become the global economic system that it deserves to be.',

  'Biofourmis raises $35M to develop smarter treatments for chronic diseases – TechCrunch\nBiofourmis raises $35M to develop smarter treatments for chronic diseases\nJon Russell\n@jonrussell\n/\n1 month\nBiofourmis, a Singapore-based startup pioneering a distinctly tech-based approach to the treatment of chronic conditions, has raised a $35 million Series B round for expansion.\nThe round was led by Sequoia India and MassMutual Ventures,\nthe VC fund from Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company. Other investors who put in include EDBI, the corporate investment arm of Singapore’s Economic Development Board, China-based healthcare platform Jianke and existing investors Openspace Ventures,\nAviva Ventures and SGInnovate, a Singapore government initiative for deep tech startups. The round takes Biofourmis to $41.6 million raised to date, according to Crunchbase.\nThis isn’t your typical TechCrunch funding story.\nBiofourmis\nCEO Kuldeep Singh Rajput moved to Singapore to start a PhD, but he dropped out to start the business with co-founder Wendou Niu in 2015 because he saw the potential to “predict disease before it happens,” he told TechCrunch in an interview.\nAI-powered specialist post-discharge care\nThere are a number of layers to Biofourmis’ work, but essentially it uses a combination of data collected from patients and an AI-based system to customize treatments for post-discharge patients. The company is focused on a range of therapeutics, but its most advanced is cardiac, so patients who have been discharged after heart failure or other heart-related conditions.\nWith that segment of patients, the Biofourmis platform uses a combination of data from sensors — medical sensors rather than consumer wearables, which are worn 24/7 — and its tech to monitor patient health, detect problems ahead of time and\xa0prescribe an optimum treatment course. That information is disseminated through companion mobile apps for patients and caregivers.\nBiofourmis uses a mobile app as a touch point to give patients tailored care and drug prescriptions after they are discharged from the hospital\nThat’s to say that medicine works differently on different people, so by collecting and monitoring data and crunching numbers, Biofourmis can provide the best drug to help optimize a patient’s health through what it calls a “digital pill.” That’s not Matrix-style futurology, it’s more like a digital prescription that evolves based on the needs of a patient in real time. It plans to use a network of medical delivery platforms, including Amazon-owned PillPack,\nto get the drugs to patients within hours.\nYes, that’s future tense because Biofourmis is waiting on FDA approval to commercialize its service. That’s expected to come by the end of this year, Singh Rajput told TechCrunch. But he’s optimistic, given clinical trials, which have covered some 5,000 patients across 20 different sites.\nOn the tech side, Singh Rajput said Biofourmis has seen impressive results with its predictions. He cited tests in the U.S. that enabled the company to “predict heart failure 14 days in advance” with around 90% sensitivity. That was achieved using standard medical wearables at the cost of hundreds of dollars, rather than thousands, with advanced kit such as Heartlogic from Boston Scientific — although the latter has a longer window for predictions.\nThat type of disruption from Biofourmis might appear to upset the apple cart for pharma companies, but Singh Rajput maintains that the industry is moving toward a more qualitative approach to healthcare because it has been hard to evaluate the performance of drugs and price them accordingly.\n“Today, insurance companies are blinded not having transparency on how to price drugs,” he said. “But there are already 50 drugs in the market paying based on outcomes, so the market is moving in that direction.”\nOutcome-based payments mean insurance firms reimburse all outcomes based on the performance of the drugs; in other words, how well patients recover. The rates vary, but a lack of reduction in remission rates can see insurers lower their payouts because drugs aren’t working as well as expected.\nSingh Rajput believes Biofourmis can level the playing field and added more granular transparency in terms of drug performance. He believes pharma companies are keen to show their products perform better than others, so over the long-term that’s the model Biofourmis wants to encourage.\nIndeed, the confidence is such that Biofourmis intends to initially go to market via pharma companies, which will sell the package into clinics bundled with their drugs, before moving to work with insurance firms once traction is gained. While Biofourmis is likely to be bundled with initial medication, the company will take a commission of 5-10% on the recommended drugs sold through its digital pill.\nBiofourmis CEO and co-founder Kuldeep Singh Rajput dropped out of his PhD course to start the company in 2015\nDoubling down on the U.S.\nWith its new money, Biofourmis is doubling down on that imminent commercialization by relocating its headquarters to Boston. It will retain its presence in Singapore, where it has 45 people who handle software and product development, but the new U.S. office is slated to grow from 14 staff right now to up to 120 by the end of the year.\n“The U.S. has been a major market focus since day one,” Singh Rajput said. “Being closer to customers and attracting the clinical data science pool is critical.”\nWhile he praised Singapore and said the company remains committed to the country — adding EDBI to its investors is certainly a sign — he admitted that Boston, where he once studied, is a key market for finding “data scientists with core clinical capabilities.”\nThat expansion is not only to bring the cardio product to market, but also to prepare products to cover other therapeutics. Right now, it has six trials in place that cover pain,\xa0orthopedics and oncology. There are also plans to expand in other markets outside of the U.S, and in particular Singapore and China, where Biofourmis plans to lead on Jianke.\nNot lacking in confidence, Singh Rajput told TechCrunch that the company is on course to reach a $1 billion valuation when it next raises funding — that’s estimated as 18 months away and the company isn’t saying how much it is worth today.\nSingh Rajput did confirm, however, that the round was heavily oversubscribed, and that the startup rebuffed investment offers from pharma companies in order to “avoid a conflict of interest and stay neutral.”\nHe is also eyeing a future IPO, which is tentatively set for 2023 — although by then, Singh Rajput said, Biofourmis would need at least two products in the market.\nThere’s a long way to go before then, but this round has certainly put Biofourmis and its digital pill approach on the map within the tech industry.',

  'Amazon’s Alexa Fund invests in edtech startups Zoobean and Unruly Studios – TechCrunch\nAmazon’s Alexa Fund invests in edtech startups Zoobean and Unruly Studios\nSarah Perez\n@sarahintampa\n/\n1 month\nTwo edtech companies, Zoobean and Unruly Studios, are the latest to receive investment from Amazon’s Alexa Fund — Amazon’s\ncorporate venture fund focused on fueling innovation in voice technologies, and specifically, integrations with Amazon’s voice assistant Alexa. Zoobean, which you may recall from its Shark Tank appearance a few years ago, offers reading software to schools and libraries. And Unruly Studios, a 2018 Alexa Accelerator alum, connects STEM learning for kids with physical play.\nZoobean\nmakes a software platform called Beanstack, which helps educators and librarians run reading challenges and learn about participants’ progress from data-driven insights.\nFollowing its initial debut on Shark Tank, where it received investment from Mark Cuban, the company has continued to develop its software and expand its footprint. Today, Beanstack is licensed to more than 1,200 public libraries and schools worldwide, and is often referred to as the “Fitbit for reading” because of how it tracks and rewards progress.\nAlong with Alexa Fund,\nCuban has also re-invested in the platform, joined by EAI Technologies, Jo and Elizabeth Tango, Pamela Bass-Bookey and Harry Bookey and Neil Jaffe of Booksource. The company didn’t share the round’s size, and Amazon declines to share the size of its Alexa Fund investments.\nZoobean is now exploring ways to integrate Alexa into Beanstack so readers can ask Alexa to track their progress or send them reminders about reading time.\nUnruly Studios,\nmeanwhile, is approaching learning through play. Led by Bryanne Leeming, the team includes gaming veterans from Mattel, Nickelodeon, iRobot, Hasbro and elsewhere who have designed a product called Unruly Splats — a programmable floor tile that pairs with an app in order to allow kids to play recess-style games. For example, the tiles can be used for things like musical chairs, whack-a-mole, relay races and more.\nThe company participated in the Alexa Accelerator last year — in fact, they even connected Zoobean founder Felix Lloyd with the Alexa Fund, as it turns out. Unruly Studios is now exploring ways to connect its “Splats” with Alexa to make the experience more engaging, while also teaching kids programming fundamentals and voice design.\nThe Alexa Fund investment was part of its seed round of $1.8 million, which closed in April, also announced today. The round was led by eCoast Angels, and saw participation from new and existing investors including AT&T, Rough Draft Ventures powered by General Catalyst, Techstars, LearnLaunch, NextFab and other New England angel funds.\n“We were so impressed by Unruly Studios during their time with the Alexa Accelerator last summer, and we’re thrilled to be reinvesting here as part of their seed round,” said Paul Bernard, director of the Alexa Fund, about Amazon’s investment. “Their ability to combine STEM education with physical games is inspiring on its own, and we see voice as a way to make that experience even more fun and engaging. We can’t wait to see what they build in the future.”\nThese aren’t the Alexa Fund’s first investments in edtech, however. Last fall, the fund invested in voice-based software and services company Bamboo Learning, for example. It also invested in Sphero, which more recently pivoted to education with Sphero Edu.\n“One of the reasons I’m so optimistic about voice technology is because it creates this communal experience where multiple people can share in the interaction,” said Mark Cuban, in a statement about the Alexa Fund investments. “Every startup founder should be looking at how voice services like Alexa fit into their business model, and it’s great to see companies like Zoobean and Unruly take that to heart. I’m excited to see them evolve their products and use voice to make reading and STEM accessible to more people.”',

  'Blockchain blockchain Malkovich blockchain – TechCrunch\nBlockchain blockchain Malkovich blockchain\nJon Evans\n@rezendi\n/\n1 month\nI spent much of last week at blockchain conferences, and I’m about ready to never hear the word again. This despite the fact I’ve been supporting decentralized software, as a counterweight or at least alternative to the growing power of governments and megacorps, for years now. Do you think blockchains are no answer? Great, let’s discuss! I wholeheartedly support you skeptics with whom I cautiously disagree. What I can’t stand, it turns out, is an endless sea of true believers nominally on my side.\nThe believers are twofold, and the two groups grate differently. One group is there almost purely because there is money in the space: Wall Street types hoping to rule a new asset-tokenized world which may come to be; financial startups offering blockchain versions of existing financial tools; new marketplaces just like old marketplaces, except On The Blockchain, and therefore better.\nIt’s all too easy to envision a future in which the collective vampire squid that is the financial industry — which has gone from taking 14% of all US profits in 1985 to consistently raking in more like 25% over the last couple of decades — ironically turns blockchains into a tool for “financializing” the economy even more, routing every global transaction through even more middlepeople, each of them shaving off a basis point or two. I doubt this will ever happen — but it’s the clear goal of much of group one.\n(And before you even think about blaming regulators for this continued attempt at creeping financialization, consider that the cryptocurrency casino is full of so much shadiness it serves as a superb object example of why regulators exist, even if a few of their rules are a bit hidebound and baffling in today’s world.)\nNeedless to say this was not the original vision. The original vision of Bitcoin was, quote, “A Peer-To-Peer Electronic Cash System.” How has that worked out? Well, as Tom Howard puts it, “It’s 2019. Where the fuck is our Global Peer-To-Peer Electronic Cash System?”1 His conclusion: still not here.\nHe has a point — but in many ways the Bitcoin community is among the most admirable in the space. Their vision may have pivoted, from “medium of exchange” to “decentralized store of value,” but it is clear, and it is succeeding, they are making both sacrifices and technical leaps to advance it. (And maybe one day Lightning will provide us all scalable peer-to-peer payments atop Bitcoin. Maybe. One day.) Furthermore, people actually use Bitcoin in sizable numbers … albeit mostly for speculation.\nThe other group of true believers is the technical group, for whom I should have more love, as an engineer myself. But so much blockchain engineering is built on the unexamined presumption that blockchains are inevitably going to become wildly important, rather than an attempt to actually make them important in any way … again, other than the decentralized global casino of unregulated speculation.\nThere are still projects I like. Ethereum offered us the breakthrough concept of decentralized applications, although it turns out their usage rate is flat. Cosmos is an important and scalable alternative to Ethereum’s approach, although it’s only just launched. Blockstack’s approach is even more interesting, although the most successful Blockstack app — by far — has only 8,000 installs, still basically a rounding error, albeit one with an impressive growth rate.\nAnd yet most of the non-financial people I met or read about last week were building new blockchains, or new tools for blockchains, new governance or voting systems to run atop blockchains, new blockchain analytics platforms, new ways to scale blockchains to handle the inevitable immense demand for their capacity … which is not at all apparent. The industry has so much potential, everyone agrees. It’s so revolutionary. It’s going to change everything. It’s going to be so important for the unbanked, everyone agreed, while standing in rooms full of bankers.\nMeanwhile the decentralized Internet, “Web 3.0,” is beginning to feel like nuclear fusion or superpower Brazil: perpetually 10 years away. The belief is that scaling must be solved first — but premature scaling is exactly the mistake which has killed many a startup. Almost everyone in the space, financial or technical, seems primarily focused on tooling, infrastructure, platforms, and scaling, and writes off the lack of any non-believer users as merely “a UX problem” to vaguely be solved somehow in the future.\nMaybe. Or maybe, a decade on from the Bitcoin whitepaper, it’s past time to instead be building applications that unbelievers who don’t care one whit about blockchains actually want to use, in the course of their everyday existence, at home and/or at work. If there are any fundamental issues other than scaling which prevent that from happening, then maybe it’s past time to focus on them instead.\n1 I feel compelled to note that Mr. Howard actually wrote “f*ck” to preserver his readers’ delicate sensibilities; TechCrunch, of course, has a long and proud history of not worrying about those.',

About 20 percent will be senior-level managers, which is part of an effort to flatten the company’s organizational structure.\nEight hundred of the job cuts will happen in North America, with 500 of them coming on Tuesday. The cuts will be complete by August, Ford said. Some contract workers will also lose their jobs, though the company didn’t specify how many. Ford also didn’t say what divisions might see the most losses, though a bulk of the 7,000 eliminated jobs are likely to come from the company’s decision to close a plant and leave the South American commercial truck market. Including non-salaried workers, Ford has a global workforce of just over 200,000.\nThe company announced an $11 billion restructuring last July, but it has been slow with details\nThe cuts are part of an $11 billion restructuring that was announced last July by Jim Hackett, Ford’s CEO. Hackett was brought over from Ford’s Smart Mobility division in 2017 to replace Mark Fields, who was CEO for three years.\nThe company tapped Hackett for his reputation as a leader at furniture company Steelcase, but also because he seemed more willing to embrace relationships with Silicon Valley, something all of the major automakers have been looking for as they face increasing competition from tech companies.\nHackett has helped oversee the launch of an entirely new spinoff company dedicated to autonomous vehicles, a $500 million investment in EV startup Rivian, and a number of software and cloud efforts meant to make the company’s cars more connected.\nHe also had to wrestle with the company’s lagging performance in the stock market, which is what drove the $11 billion restructuring. While it was announced last year, Hackett has been largely mum on what the shakeup would look like.\nIt’s only in the last few months that Ford has started to let out more details about how the company will change. A big piece is that Ford announced a “global alliance” with Volkswagen in January centered on pickup trucks and commercial vans, with an eye on autonomous and electric vehicles as well.\nBut now we finally know how many of the company’s employees Ford is willing to let go in order to scale down its operating costs as it takes on all of these new efforts.\nNext Up In\nTransportation\nGood Deals\nXbox One controllers, natively supported in iOS 13, are much cheaper today\nPlus, save on Logitech PC accessories and Samsung’s Galaxy S10 lineup\nThe Fujifilm X-T2 mirrorless camera body is cheaper than ever\nSave on the 2016 camera, the latest iPad Air, and more\nMore in Good Deals\nVerge3.0_Logomark_Color_1\nSign up for the\nnewsletter\nCommand Line\nCommand Line delivers daily updates from the near-future.\nEmail (required)\nSubscribe\nBy signing up, you agree to our Privacy Policy and European users agree to the data transfer policy.\nThis Article has a component height of 10.

  'Y Combinator promotes Geoff Ralston to president, while Sam Altman shifts to advisor role – TechCrunch\nY Combinator promotes Geoff Ralston to president, while Sam Altman shifts to advisor role\nConnie Loizos\n@Cookie\n/\n1 month\nTwo months ago, when Sam Altman\nsurprised the industry by stepping away from his post as the president of Y Combinator to become the CEO of OpenAI, an artificial intelligence-focused company, TechCrunch was told there were no plans to replace Altman.\nApparently, there were no immediate plans. This morning, the popular accelerator program and investment firm is announcing that it has promoted longtime partner Geoff Ralston\nto president.\nIt’s an unsurprising choice for YC, an organization that employs roughly 60 people, many of whom have been affiliated with it in one way or another for years. When its founders, Paul Graham and Jessica Livingston, first looked for someone to lead the rocket ship they had built, they quickly identified Altman, who was part of the first class of Y Combinator\nand who later helped them advise YC startups.\nSimilarly, Graham has known Ralston for 20 years; they met at Yahoo, where both landed through acquisitions. Graham sold his company, Viaweb, a web-based application that allowed users to build and host their own online stores, to Yahoo in 1998. Ralston built RocketMail, one of the first web mail services, which in 1997 became Yahoo Mail.\nRalston later logged time as the CEO of a streaming music service, Lala Media, that sold to Apple in 2009. He then co-founded — with Graham’s help — Imagine K12, an edtech accelerator that funded companies like ClassDojo, among others, before Ralston and Graham decided to merge it into YC in 2016.\nWe talked with both Ralston and Altman last night about the appointment, and Ralston sounded very enthusiastic. “Following P.G. and Sam is a daunting but incredibly exciting prospect for me. I feel like I was made for this job.”\nSlightly more surprising: As part of the announcement, Altman, who was named chairman of YC as he was transitioning out the door a few months ago, tells us now that he will no longer hold that title, that he will instead be an advisor and “available” to YC. He said that his heart now is really with OpenAI (more on that here). He also wants to give Ralston space, saying that “one thing that P.G. did for me was just make it very clear [to everyone] that I was in charge. My shoes aren’t as big to fill, but I want to do the same for Geoff.”\nWe asked Ralston last night if Altman had given him any advice — or shared horror stories. (“I didn’t shy away from the hard parts, but the good parts are really obvious, including YC’s impact and the quality of people we work with,” said Altman.)\nWe also asked if there was anything Ralston might want to change about YC straightaway, knowing the organization as well as he does. On this front, both men noted that they have worked closely for years (and known each other for ten), with Ralston adding that under his leadership, “The job should look much the same; so much of YC works incredibly well.”\nAs for the process involved in selecting Ralston, YC isn’t saying exactly. The broader point, apparently, is that he’s the right person for the job. “The whole partnership was excited about this,” said Altman. “A number of people could do the job [inside of YC]. I think Geoff will be exceptional.”\nRalston has personally invested in more than 100 companies, says YC. He’s also the longest tenured partner, along with Gmail creator Paul Buchheit, who joined YC in 2010.\nMost recently, he helped scale YC’s free online program, Startup School. Below is one piece of related programming from last fall, with Ralston talking about fundraising fundamentals.',
  'ByteDance, TikTok’s parent company, plans to launch a free music streaming app – TechCrunch\nByteDance, TikTok’s parent company, plans to launch a free music streaming app\nManish Singh\n1 month\nDoes the overcrowded and cut-throat music streaming business have room for an additional player? The world’s most valuable startup certainly thinks so.\nChinese conglomerate ByteDance,\nvalued at more than $75 billion, is working on a music streaming service, two sources familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. The company, which operates popular app TikTok, has held discussions with music labels in recent months to launch the app as soon as the end of this quarter, one of the sources said.\nThe app will offer both a premium and an ad-supported free tier, one of the sources said. Bloomberg, which first wrote about the premium app, reported that ByteDance is targeting emerging markets with its new music app. A ByteDance spokesperson declined to comment.\nFor ByteDance, interest in a music app does not come as a surprise. Snippets of pop songs from movies and albums intertwined with videos shot by its humongous user base is part of the service’s charm. The company already works with music labels worldwide to licence usage of their tracks on its platform. In China, where ByteDance claims to have tie-ups with more than 800 labels, it has been aggressively expanding efforts to find music talents and urge them to make their own tracks.\nBesides, ByteDance has been expanding its app portfolio in recent months. Earlier this year, the company released Duoshan, a video chat app that appears to be a mix of TikTok and Snap. This week, it\xa0launched Feiliao, another chat app that is largely focused on text-driven conversations. At some point, the company may have realized the need for a standalone music consumption app.\nWhen asked about TikTok’s\npartnership with music labels last month, Todd Schefflin, TikTok’s head of global music business development, told\xa0WSJ that music is part of the app’s “creative DNA” but it is “ultimately for short video creation and viewing, not a product for music consumption.”\nThe private Chinese company is likely eyeing India as a key market for its music app. The company has been in discussion with local music labels T Series and Times Music for rights. Moreover, its apps are estimated to have more than 300 million monthly active users in the nation, though there could be significant overlaps among them.\nIndia may have also inspired ByteDance to consider a free, ad-supported version of its music app. Even as more than 150 million users in India listen to music online, only a tiny portion of this user base is willing to pay for it.\nThis has made India a unique battleground for local and international music giants, most of which offer an ad-supported, free version of their apps in the market. Even premium offerings from Apple\nand Spotify\ncost less than $1.2 a month. India is the only market where Spotify offers a free version of its app that has access to the entire catalog on demand.\nThe launch of the app could put the spotlight again on ByteDance in India, where its TikTok app recently landed in hot water. An Indian court banned the app for roughly a week after expressing concerns over questionable content on the platform. Ever since the nation lifted the ban on TikTok, the company has become visibly cautious about its movement.',

  'In-car commerce startup Cargo extends Uber partnership to Brazil – TechCrunch\nIn-car commerce startup Cargo extends Uber partnership to Brazil\nKirsten Korosec\n1 month\nCargo,\nthe startup that brings the convenience store into ride-hailing vehicles, is making its first international expansion through an exclusive partnership with Uber\nin Brazil.\nUber drivers in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro will now be able to sign up for Cargo and potentially earn additional income by selling products to passengers during their ride.\nCargo, which launched in 2017, provides qualified ridesharing drivers with free boxes filled with the kinds of goods you might find in a convenience store, including snacks and phone chargers. Riders can use Cargo’s mobile web menu on their smartphones (without downloading an app) to buy what they need.\nThe expansion into Brazil includes a relationship with am/pm convenience stores. In Brazil, about 2,500 am/pm stores are operated and located in Ipiranga gas stations. Uber drivers that sign up with Cargo will collect their boxes of products at these stores.\nThe announcement is an extension of a partnership with Uber that began last July in San Francisco and Los Angeles. Cargo and Uber have added more U.S. cities to the partnership, including Boston, Miami, New York and Washington, D.C.\nThe move will give Cargo access to the more than 600,000 Uber drivers in Brazil. It also signals the beginning of what will be a broader global expansion for the company. Some 20,000 U.S. drivers have used the Cargo service.\nIn October, Cargo announced it had raised $22 million in a Series A round led by Founders Fund. The Series A round included additional investment from Aquiline Technology Growth, Coatue Management and a number of high-profile entertainment, gaming and technology executives such as Zynga\xa0founder Mark Pincus, Twitch’s former CSO Colin Carrier, media investor Vivi Nevo, former NBA commissioner David Stern, Def Jam Records CEO Paul Rosenberg, Steve Aoki, Maria Shriver and Patrick and Christina Schwarzenegger.\nTo date,\xa0Cargo has raised $30 million in venture funding.',
  'The Trade Desk hires Jonathan Carson as its first CRO – TechCrunch\nThe Trade Desk hires Jonathan Carson as its first CRO\nAnthony Ha\n@anthonyha\n/\n1 month\nAdtech company The Trade Desk is announcing that it’s hired its very first chief revenue officer, Jonathan Carson.\nCarson’s past roles include serving as president of Mic, chief revenue officer at Vevo and CEO of digital for Nielsen.\nHe told me he was excited to join The Trade Desk\nbecause it’s “a spectacular story” of “a relatively young company that has grown to scale remarkably quickly.” (It was founded in 2009 and in its most recent quarter grew revenue 41% year-over-year, to $121 million.)\n“If you look at the mission of The Trade Desk, it’s essentially to fund media, and if you look at what that really means, it’s the journalism, the pop culture, the music that we all love,” Carson said. “It was built to make the economics of those individual creators and the companies … feasible, and to help them thrive in a moment where digital media has turned a lot of those business models inside out.”\nBy coming on as The Trade Desk’s first CRO, Carson said his role will be serving as the member of the executive team who’s “singularly focused” on driving revenue growth. And he pointed to two “really big growth levers” that the company is focused on currently — video and connected TV, and international growth, particularly in China, where the company launched its programmatic ad platform in March.\nWe are thrilled to add Jonathan’s deep experience in digital media to our executive leadership team as we continue our rapid growth,” said Trade Desk founder and CEO Jeff Green in a statement. “Jonathan’s focus on revenue generation and client acquisition will help us continue to gain share in the global digital advertising market, including new channels such as Connected TV, and massive emerging consumer markets, such as China.”\nThe Trade Desk finishes strong at $30.10 per share after its first day on NASDAQ',
  'Select FCC leaders announce support for T-Mobile, Sprint merger – TechCrunch\nSelect FCC leaders announce support for T-Mobile, Sprint merger\nBrian Heater\n@bheater\n/\n1 month\nIt’s been more than a year since T-Mobile\nand Sprint formally announced a merger agreement. This morning, members of FCC leadership have issued statements voicing their support for the $26 billion proposal.\nAjit Pai was first out with a statement, suggesting that the pricey consolidation of two of the Unites States’ largest carriers would help accelerate his longstanding desire to provide more internet coverage to rural areas.\n“Demonstrating that 5G will indeed benefit rural Americans,” Pai wrote, “T-Mobile and Sprint\nhave promised that their network would cover at least two-thirds of our nation’s rural population with highs peed, mid-band 5G, which could improve the economy and quality of life in many small towns across the country.”\nThe FCC\nchairman went on to suggest that the merger “is in the public interest,” adding that he would recommend fellow members of the commission’s leadership approve it. Commissioner Brendan Carr followed soon after with his own statement of approval, suggesting that a merger would actually increase competition.\n“I support the combination of T-Mobile and Sprint because Americans across the country will see more competition and an accelerated buildout of fast, 5G services,” the Commissioner writes. “The proposed transaction will strengthen competition in the U.S. wireless market and provide mobile and in-home broadband access to communities that demand better coverage and more choices.”\nA number of ground rules have been laid out for approval. In a bid for approval, Sprint has promised to sell off prepaid brand Boost Mobile. “[W]e have committed to divest Sprint’s Boost pre-paid business to a third party following the closing of the merger,” T-Mobile CEO John Legere said in a blog post following the statements of support. “We’ll work to find a serious, credible, financially capable and independent buyer for all the assets needed to run – and grow – the business, and we’ll make sure that buyer has attractive wholesale arrangements.”',
  'HolodeckVR raises €3M from Germany’s ProSiebenSat1 to put VR onto dodgems – TechCrunch\nHolodeckVR raises €3M from Germany’s ProSiebenSat1 to put VR onto dodgems\nMike Butcher\n@mikebutcher\n/\n1 month\nConsumer VR might not have taken off in the mainstream but it’s still fun to use, and it’s even more fun to use in groups. There is more of an arcade renaissance for VR going on right now, as well as location-based multi-user VR experiences.\nThat’s the premise behind Munich-based HolodeckVR which is using proprietary tech to blend radio frequency, IR tracking and on-device IMUs to bring multi-user positionally tracked VR to mobile headsets.\nHow would you like to do VR in a big group, and on fairground dodgems/bumper cars? That’s the kind of thing this startup is cooking up.\nAs a spin-off from the prestigious Fraunhofer Institute for Integrated Ciruits IIS, it uses its own technology which allows its visitors to experience virtual reality in groups of up to 20 people and move around in an empty space of 10x20m, all just wearing VR goggles.\nHolodeck says it can be used for different types of events (entertainment, birthday parties and corporate team building) and work through several thousands of guests per day.\nIt’s now raised €3 million from strategic partner ProSiebenSat.1, the leading German entertainment player. This will allow Holodeck to expand its open content platform and extend its network of locations.\nThe Munich-based media company owns a potential distribution channel for scaling Holodeck VR locations at leisure- and activity parks, while other synergies related to ProSiebenSat.1, including live broadcasting and VR content generation.\nWith 7Sports, the sports business units of ProSiebenSat.1, Holodeck VR plans eSports events leveraging the Holodeck VR platform.\nJonathan Nowak Delgado says: “With this investment, we’ll aim to become the VR touchpoint for the next generation by offering exciting new experiences that are simple, social, and fun.”\nHolodeck VR’s experiences combine the real world and digital world so that you can take a ride in bumper cars or on a rollercoaster.\nYou’d think they’d need to have plenty of sick bags at the ready, but in fact you cannot get sea-sick in freeroam VR systems (as the VR moves with your movements). In addition, it’s one of the most precise tracking systems out there and one of the few kids can play.',

We should seize this opportunity.”\nThe two companies announced their intentions to merge last April, posing a deal worth around $26 billion that would shrink the nation’s wireless carrier pool from four major companies down to three. This change in market competition has long been a sticking point for both regulators and lawmakers on Capitol Hill, but Pai believes the merger would spur more benefits than harms overall.\nThe FCC’s approval comes with specific “enforceable” requirements\nThe FCC’s approval comes with specific “enforceable” requirements. According to T-Mobile CEO John Legere, the New T-Mobile will need to roll out low-band 5G to 97 percent of the US population and mid-band spectrum 5G to 75 percent in three years. Low-band 5G will need to be extended to 99 percent and mid-band 5G to 88 percent after six years. There are specific goals for rural America as well, including extending low-band 5G to 85 percent of those areas in three years and bumping that up to 90 percent after six years.\nThe New T-Mobile will be required to file an annual “report card” with the FCC detailing its progress on 5G deployment. Compliance tests will be conducted by independent third parties paid for by the New T-Mobile. The companies have also agreed to launch in-home broadband across the country as well, but it’s unclear to how many households and at what speeds.\nBoost Mobile will also be divested so the New T-Mobile will have to compete against it in the prepaid market.\nThe two companies have repeatedly promised to drive down wireless prices (or at least keep them the same), and they reaffirmed that promise in a statement put out by Legere today. No commitments have been made on pricing after three years of closing, however.\n“It’s also important that the companies would suffer serious consequences if they fail to follow through on their commitments to the FCC,” Pai said. “These consequences, which could include total payments to the US Treasury of billions of dollars, create a powerful incentive for the companies to meet their commitments on time.”\nBoth Pai and Commissioner Brendan Carr have already voiced support for the measure. The merger still needs approval from the Justice Department before it can close.\nUpdated 5/20/19 at 1:55 p.m.: Updated to clarify that the merger will not be voted on at the June Open Meeting.\nIn this Storystream\nT-Mobile and Sprint: all the news about the merger\nT-Mobile and Sprint are reportedly nearing a deal with Dish to save their merger\nFCC chair will approve T-Mobile and Sprint merger after promises of fast 5G rollout\nSprint will sell off Boost Mobile if merger with T-Mobile is approved\nView all 28 stories\nNext Up In\nPolicy\nGood Deals\nXbox One controllers, natively supported in iOS 13, are much cheaper today\nPlus, save on Logitech PC accessories and Samsung’s Galaxy S10 lineup\nThe Fujifilm X-T2 mirrorless camera body is cheaper than ever\nSave on the 2016 camera, the latest iPad Air, and more\nYou can still save $200 on a Samsung Galaxy S10E\nNew deals, plus a few Father’s Day offers that are still active\nMore in Good Deals\nVerge3.0_Logomark_Color_1\nSign up for the\nnewsletter\nCommand Line\nCommand Line delivers daily updates from the near-future.\nEmail (required)\nSubscribe\nBy signing up, you agree to our Privacy Policy and European users agree to the data transfer policy.\nThis Article has a component height of 12.

Then she became involved in an unusual plan - to help fulfil a stranger\'s dying wish of fathering a child.In 2013, Liat Malka was a single, 35-year-old kindergarten teacher living in southern Israel, when she felt the urgency of her biological clock ticking."I was worrying about time passing and maybe missing out on motherhood," Liat says. "So I went to the doctor and did some fertility tests."When the results came back, they suggested that the number of eggs Liat had left was low. The doctor warned that if she waited for the right person to come along she might not ever become a mother. "So right away I decided that I would do anything I could to have a baby as soon as possible," Liat says.\nWhen Liat arrived home, she immediately went online to explore her options."I really wanted my child to know their father and that\'s not possible with a sperm donor," she says. Find out moreLiat Malka and Julia Pozniansky spoke to Outlook on the BBC World Service Listen again hereBut then Liat stumbled across an interview on YouTube that had been broadcast on TV news in 2009.\nIn it, a couple called Vlad and Julia Pozniansky explained that they were trying to obtain legal permission to have a child using sperm left by their son, who had died the previous year. They had already found a woman to be the mother of their son\'s child. Liat wondered if a similar arrangement might also be a good option for her: "Because this way the child can know who their father was, know their history and have grandparents and family," she says.She decided to contact the couple\'s lawyer to ask for more details - and was surprised to learn that although four years had passed since the interview had been recorded, Vlad and Julia still didn\'t have a grandchild and the woman selected to be the mother was no longer on board. Liat arranged to meet the Poznianskys and on the day of the meeting the couple brought with them an album filled with photographs of their beloved son, Baruch.\nImage copyright\nJulia Pozniansky\nImage caption\nBaruch Pozniansky\nMore than a decade after his death, Julia still finds it almost unbearable to talk about her "brilliant, outstanding" son.At 23, while studying ecology at the Technion, a renowned university in Haifa, Baruch noticed a wound in his mouth that wouldn\'t stop bleeding. It was later diagnosed as cancer. Because chemotherapy can slow down or stop sperm production, some of his sperm was banked and frozen before he began treatment. He lost his hair and eventually doctors had to partially remove his tongue, leaving him unable to speak - but not before he made a wish."He said that if he died he wanted us to find an appropriate woman and use his sperm to have a child," Julia says.Baruch died on 7 November 2008 at the age of 25. He was single and childless.Almost immediately Julia set to work trying to fulfil her deceased son\'s wish.Before his death he had created a biological will with the lawyer, Irit Rosenblum. Rosenblum has spearheaded the posthumous reproduction cause in Israel and Baruch was the first person in the world to create such a will, which made his biological legacy legally binding - in this case, the banking of his sperm for the purpose of fathering a child.Julia\'s task was not only to find a woman to be the child\'s mother, but also to get permission from an Israeli court to gain access to the sperm.\nWith Irit Rosenblum\'s help, Vlad and Julia eventually found an Israeli woman of Russian origin who they thought could be a mother to their grandchild. They went to court to obtain permission to use Baruch\'s sperm and won their case, but within a week or two the woman had met a new partner and withdrawn from their agreement."Another young woman came to us, a very nice one," Julia says. The woman\'s name was added to the court verdict, instead of the first woman, and she began the IVF process. But after seven rounds the woman had failed to conceive, leaving the finite supply of Baruch\'s sperm depleted. "I was ready not to live any more. But I decided that if I was going to live I had to return some happiness to my life, and some love," she says."I wanted my son to continue living - somewhere deep in my heart I wanted to return him physically - I thought maybe a boy would be born who would look like Baruch." Uncertain whether she\'d ever be able to fulfil Baruch\'s dying wish, and longing for a baby in her life, at 55 Julia started trying with Vlad for another child, using IVF and a donor egg.When their son was born, Julia says it felt like breathing fresh air again.\nJulia clearly remembers the day that she and her husband first met Liat in early 2013."She was a beautiful young woman. Black hair, red coat, and I loved her from the very beginning," Julia says. "I saw that she was a good person."She showed Liat the album of photos of Baruch that she\'d brought with her and Liat says she felt an immediate connection to him."Just looking at the pictures I already knew who this person was - such good eyes, the biggest smile you can ever imagine, surrounded with friends and very handsome," she says.\nImage copyright\nJulia Pozniansky\nImage caption\nJulia, Vlad and Baruch in Germany\n"And it looked like he was really connected to his parents, because in every picture they are holding hands and hugging. I could see the love and the happiness in his eyes - there was no doubt he was a great person."As Julia showed Liat the photos, she talked about how much Baruch had loved life, how smart he was, and how sociable, how he\'d loved cooking and what great friends he\'d had.In that moment Liat decided that she wanted Baruch, a man she had never met and who had died five years previously, to be the father of her child.\nLiat, Vlad and Julia signed contracts which gave Liat ownership of the sperm so that nobody else could use it subsequently, and the contract also formalised arrangements for Vlad and Julia to visit. "To protect our rights to see the child," Julia explains. "We were doing it not only to fulfil Baruch\'s will, but also to have a dear, beloved grandchild."No money changed hands - something that was very important to Vlad and Julia, in order to prevent attracting the wrong type of person.Julia and Liat then had to meet a social worker who questioned them about what conflicts they anticipated in their relationship and even about what would happen if they quarrelled over what the child would be named. Julia felt as though the whole judicial system was playing God, deciding if a human being would live or not, and she told the social worker as much. "And this nice woman felt really uncomfortable with my answer," she says.Liat then began fertility treatment, but her first round of IVF was unsuccessful."There was just one egg," Liat says. "That was a shock - I expected more - and then it didn\'t develop to be an embryo."\nLiat tried to remain hopeful, but despite being given an increased dose of the medication which encourages the ovaries to produce more eggs, on the second attempt again there was only one egg."They fertilised it and I had to wait for a day and then call to find out if it was developing into an embryo," Liat says.This time there was good news. "I thought, \'Wow, maybe this is it?\'" The fertilised egg was transferred into Liat\'s womb. For a week she rested, waited and hoped, then took a pregnancy test and called the hospital for the results."They were yelling like, \'Yeah, you\'re pregnant!\'" Liat says.Liat shared the exciting news first with her sister and then with Julia. Then, over the following few days, the seriousness of her situation began to sink in."I was in shock - I didn\'t think it was going to happen," Liat admits. "So when it did I just couldn\'t believe it. I didn\'t even know Vlad and Julia that much - I\'d only met them two or maybe three times."Liat was worried about how her own family would get along with Baruch\'s family - her parents had come to Israel from Morocco, while Vlad and Julia come from Russia. The two families are culturally very different, she says.At this point she had not even told her own mother about meeting Vlad and Julia and the plan to become a mother to their dead son\'s child."I didn\'t want the burden of everyone\'s opinions, especially my mum\'s, so I had kept it a secret," she says. "But when I called her to say I was pregnant she was happy - at least I was having a child!"Liat\'s pregnancy progressed but her doubts didn\'t diminish. She was very stressed and couldn\'t cope with trying to forge a relationship with Vlad and Julia while trying to grow a baby. At night she would dream about how her child might look.Julia, too, was worried. She wanted to be closer to Liat, but had to respect Liat\'s wishes and keep her distance."I spoke to one of my relatives, a very wise woman, and she said, \'Let her have her child and afterwards everything will be OK,\'" Julia says.\nImage copyright\nLiat Malka\nImage caption\nLiat after giving birth to Shira\nWhen Liat went into labour she didn\'t feel comfortable about calling Julia to share the news, and told her own mother not to come to the hospital that evening since a doctor had advised her it was unlikely the baby would arrive before morning.\n"But at midnight she had a feeling, took a taxi and arrived at the hospital at the last minute," Liat says. "I was very happy that she came. She was in so much shock that she couldn\'t even speak. My two sisters were with me too, and I have a sister in the US who was on Skype and we put her on the shelf. It was a really amazing experience."Shira was born on 1 December 2015, more than seven years after her father had died. "She was exactly like she was in the dream," Liat says. "She was so beautiful, I really couldn\'t believe it."Liat called Vlad and Julia to tell them the news."I felt that my heart started to beat again for the first time after my terrible loss," Julia says.\nImage copyright\nLiat Malka\nImage caption\nShira in December 2018\nThe photos of Baruch that Julia brought when she first met Liat are now kept at Liat and Shira\'s apartment in Ashkelon, and they often look at them together, talking about the man in the photos who is smiling back at them. Liat points out Baruch\'s blue eyes, just like Shira\'s."One day she told me, \'Maybe soon he will knock at the door and come to see us,\'" Liat says. "So I said, \'No, he won\'t come.\'" Shira is now three. Her mother says she does sometimes worry about Shira not having a father.\nImage copyright\nJulia Pozniansky\nImage caption\nShira and Julia\n"But today you have so many kinds of families," Liat says, "This is just another one. Shira knows that she does not have a father, but she\'s very loved and she\'s very happy."And having fulfilled her dying son\'s last wish, Julia has no doubts about what she has done, and feels certain that Baruch would love his daughter too."She\'s beautiful, she\'s smart, she\'s happy, she\'s everything you could want from a child," Julia says. "She\'s perfect, she\'s really perfect."You may also be interested in...\nWhen Jessica Share bought sperm from a sperm bank in order to start a family, she never imagined that more than a decade later she would meet the donor - and would feel a strong attraction to him.I met my boyfriend 12 years after giving birth to his child\nRelated TopicsFertilityLong ReadsIsraelIVFInspiring stories\nShare this story\nAbout\xa0sharing\nEmail\nFacebook\nMessenger\nMessenger\nTwitter\nPinterest\nWhatsApp\nLinkedIn\nTop Stories\nJavid knocked out of Tory leadership contest\nBoris Johnson leads the race to be next Tory leader while Michael Gove overtakes Jeremy Hunt to move into second place.\n20 June 2019\nTory leadership race final ballot\n19 June 2019\nAbuse claims \'horrendous\' says former MP\n20 June 2019\nFeatures\nHow my sleepy hometown became a violent crime hotspot\nWhere giving vaccines can get you killed\nVideo\nChina\'s vanishing beards and mosques\nThe cafe where customers don\'t have to pay\nThe fake minister in a silicone mask who stole millions\nBrexit: Where do Conservative leadership candidates stand?\nVideo\nHow a four-day week has changed our lives\nWhy it\'s so hard to stop a cult\nVideo\nFighting vaccine fears in the UK\nElsewhere on the BBC\nEqual Playing Field\nBreaking world records to get women into football\nFull article Equal Playing Field\nDaily news briefing direct to your inbox\nSign up for our newsletter\nFull article Daily news briefing direct to your inbox\nWhy you can trust BBC News\nBBC News Navigation\nSections\nHome\nUK\nUK Home\nEngland\nN.

I would never play tennis again."A surprise pregnancy wasn\'t part of Victoria Azarenka\'s plan for the 2016 season. At the time, she was ranked sixth in the world, having won in Brisbane, Indian Wells and Miami - her 20th WTA title - earlier that year. Instead, she had to cut her season short, announcing the news of her impending new arrival via social media - sending a tweet which, she says, was like "ripping off a band aid".\n"I was scared," the 30-year-old Belarusian tells the BBC. "It wasn\'t easy."Pregnancy was a shock for Azarenka, but it quickly turned into a happy shock. She remembers crying down the phone to her mother, but when questioned, didn\'t know why she was upset.She did, however, fear that she would never step on a tennis court as a professional again."But then, it was all about knowing I was going to come back, and when I was going to come back," says the former world number one, who reached the quarter-finals in Stuttgart last month and will play at next week\'s French Open."I felt it was a blessing, but I still wanted to have my own dreams and my own career."I knew I was going to come back, but my first initial thought was \'oh my god, I\'m never going to play tennis again\'."Azarenka gave birth to Leo in December 2016 and returned to the tour the following June, reaching the fourth round of Wimbledon just over a week later."I\'m sure a lot of women won\'t be able to relate to me but I felt so much better after [pregnancy]," she says. "I felt so much stronger physically, and my body became so much better. I felt like my body finally matured into being a woman."Live scores, schedule and resultsAlerts: Get tennis news sent to your phone\'I want this to be my legacy\' - changing the rules\nAzarenka reached the quarter-finals of the Italian Open last weekAzarenka\'s return came months after 23-time Grand Slam champion Serena Williams announced her own pregnancy, going on to give birth to her daughter in September 2017.Since then, maternity policies within tennis have repeatedly hit the headlines, with the WTA canvassing the opinions of players in 2018.As a result, Azarenka and other leading players on the WTA\'s Players\' Council - including Venus Williams and Britain\'s Johanna Konta - have successfully campaigned for the introduction of more ranking protection for new mothers on the tour.Previously, players had to return to play within three years and could use a special ranking for eight tournaments within one year. From the 2019 season, players coming back from childbirth, or injury, will now be able to use their previous ranking to enter 12 tournaments over a three-year period. They will also not face a seeded player in a tournament\'s opening round."We have the power to change the rules and we have done," Azarenka says."I think that is what I want my legacy to be, that I\'m fighting for women to be more comfortable, to break those stereotypes and move the needle a little forward."That evolution is going to continue to break boundaries and the illusion of women in sport."\'I don\'t love tennis that much any more\' - on changing priorities"I\'ve got to go to work, take pictures with people and smile. Some days I do that with a lot of struggle, but some days are better."Life is tough on a "daily basis" for Azarenka. On the surface, it looks idyllic, travelling the world playing tennis: her blonde haired, blue-eyed boy by her side.But in reality, she admits she wants to "cry, hide and not see anybody".Locked in a custody battle over two-year-old Leo since 2017, the past two years have been, and continue to be, a "big challenge" for the two-time Australian Open champion.While the case has yet to be resolved, Azarenka - ranked world number 51 - returned to the WTA Tour with Leo in tow in 2018, having missed several tournaments, including the 2017 US Open.But although the experience is one she wouldn\'t wish on anyone, she admits it has provided unexpected benefits.\nLeo travels the world with his mum"As hard as this situation is, I have never been able to learn as much about myself," she says."It has forced me to go so far outside of my comfort zone. It\'s tough, but in a way I\'m grateful for this."As is the case with most new parents, having a child has completely changed Azarenka\'s perspective. While tennis was once the be-all and end-all for her, her little boy has turned that upside down."Before my son was born, tennis was my life. I said I was going to come back because it was still so important to me to prove it to people," she says."But I don\'t love it that much any more, but that\'s fine, because I want to be with my son every single minute of my life. But tennis is my job."BBC Sport has launched #ChangeTheGame this summer to showcase female athletes in a way they never have been before.

"The organiser of the event had come up to him and told him that I had been swearing, demanding to have a buggy and causing a scene."If I had caused a scene or said a bad word - which I did not - one of the organisers should have come to me, not go to Tom, where he had just won gold for his nation and had to compete again in one of the biggest events of his life in front of a home crowd."Earlier Black tweeted that he had an issue with a press release sent by British Swimming that he called "an absolute misrepresentation" of the situation, saying it had "little to nothing to do with a pram". "This organisation is corrupt," he added.In a statement to BBC Sport, British Swimming said it had "offered to put measures in place to store the buggy"."British Swimming is extremely disappointed that Tom\'s husband felt that he couldn\'t be at the London Aquatics Centre to support Tom," it said."The London Aquatics Centre\'s policy is not to allow buggies on to the spectator concourse for health and safety reasons and British Swimming supported this policy to ensure the safety of everyone attending this exciting event."British Swimming recognises the fundamental part that families play in supporting all of the athletes and offered to put measures in place to store the buggy during the event so that Tom\'s family could be present. We were pleased to see some of Tom\'s family there last night celebrating his success."\'They know they have a problem\'Black said the issue was not over the use of buggies, but a bigger problem which "happens at every British Swimming event"."This is an illness within the organisation which leads to families being kept at arm\'s length and being demonised," said Black. "There is no other country that does this. When it is a [world governing body] Fina event and not a British Swimming event, there is no problem."Any other country we go to we are made to feel welcome. What happened this weekend was a bit of the last straw. They demonise family members and treat us as if we are somehow incumbent. We would rather we are not there."Daley, who had clinched the overall individual 10m World Series crown on Friday, "probably slept a combined six hours over two nights" before claiming gold alongside diving partner Grace Reid on Sunday, says Black.\n"They [British Swimming] have still not spoken to us," said Black. "I wouldn\'t say I\'m upset; it\'s more that this problem has to be solved. Any other country welcomes you with open arms. No family in sport is the silent partner. This is the only country that looks upon families as a hurdle. "They went to Tom instead of coming to me. They upset their athlete in the middle of a very big weekend. There has been no conversation. They are very quick to kick me out for no reason but can\'t be bothered to have a conversation."Black says he "begged" British Swimming to apologise "just to get it off Tom\'s mind" but added: "They have an inability to admit they had done something wrong."\nShare\nthis page\nShare this with\nDigg\nFacebook\nGoogle\nLinkedIn\nReddit\nStumbleUpon\nTwitter\nCopy this link http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/diving/48332929 Read more about sharing.\nTop Stories\nAustralia turn screw on Bangladesh - clips, radio & text\nLive\nFrom the section Cricket\nRead more on Australia turn screw on Bangladesh - clips, radio & text\nWatch: Fifa Women\'s World Cup - Netherlands 0-0 Canada - Dutch top group as it stands\nLive\nFrom the section Football\nRead more on Watch: Fifa Women\'s World Cup - Netherlands 0-0 Canada - Dutch top group as it stands\nWatch: Fifa Women\'s World Cup - Cameroon 0-0 New Zealand - both need win to avoid exit\nLive\nFrom the section Football\nRead more on Watch: Fifa Women\'s World Cup - Cameroon 0-0 New Zealand - both need win to avoid exit\nAlso in Sport\nThe quirky stats of the Cricket World Cup Comedian Andy Zaltzman digs into the stats to show why South Africa have been a disappointment in the World Cup, and why Mark Wood is a statistical bolt from the blue.\nWatch England captain Morgan hit record 17 sixes\n\'Sam Kerr has scored them all\' - Aussie superstar hits four\nWomen\'s World Cup: Who needs what?\n\'Meeting Royal surgeon proved pivotal\' - Murray on \'life-changing\' operation\nRivals on the field, friends off it - fans light up India-Pakistan match\n\'One of the best saves at any Women\'s World Cup ever\'\nWorld sport: 10 photos we liked this week\nFive key questions for Chelsea after Sarri exit\n\'I was addicted to drugs, now I\'m addicted to running\'\nWoods hoping for 10 more years at the top of golf\nThe lost lionesses - England\'s forgotten teenage football trailblazers\nExplore the BBC\nCould you solve this maths problem?

The unidentified man was an experienced local hobbyist, shop owner Matt Cook, told the BBC. Finds of this scale by prospectors are known to happen a few times a year, experts say.About three-quarters of the gold mined in Australia is produced in and around the Kalgoorlie region.\nMr Cook, who owns a shop selling supplies to gold prospectors, said the man detected the piece on some saltbush flats, about 45cm (18 inches) below the surface."He walked into my shop and showed me the nugget in his hand with a big smile on my face," Mr Cook told the BBC."It just a bit bigger than a packet of smokes, and the density of it was incredible, so heavy."\nYou may also be interested in:\nWhat is it like to find \'treasure\'?\nHuge gold-laden rocks found in Australia\nWATCH: 5.5kg gold nugget discovered in Australia\nWorld\'s largest gold nugget remembered\nSmaller traces of gold are more common finds in the region, says Prof Sam Spearing, director of the Western Australia School of Mines at Curtin University."Along with the mines around, a lot of people go around as prospectors on the weekend, as a hobby.

Any manufacturer can modify it and install it on their devices without having to get permission. But in practice, all the major vendors rely on a lot of support from Google.In addition, Google controls access to several add-on bits of software, including:\nthe Play app store\nits own apps\nthe Google Assistant virtual helper\nthe Gmail email service\ntools that allow third-party services access to certain functions\nHow does this affect existing Huawei handsets?Owners of Huawei or Honor phones will not find that they suddenly cannot install new apps or get updates for Google services.\nImage copyright\nGetty Images\nImage caption\nHuawei shipped about 3.1 million handsets to the UK between April 2018 and March 2019, according to analysts IDC, making it the third most popular brand after Apple and Samsung\nThe reason is that their devices have already been certified under processes known as the Compatibility Test Suite (CTS) and the Vendor Test Suite (VTS).As a consequence, Google can provide them with new versions of its products and authorise downloads from its Play marketplace, without having to directly deal with Huawei itself.\nHuawei\'s use of Android restricted by Google\nVodafone\'s 5G UK service to use Huawei kit at launch\nWhy UK is at odds with its cyber-allies over Huawei\nHowever, matters become more complex when it comes to security updates.The way these typically work is that Google gives Android device-makers the code for its software fixes about one month before it reveals details to the public about the vulnerabilities involved.This gives manufacturers time to check the patches do not cause problems for their own proprietary software, and then to package up a customised version of the fixes as a download.Huawei will now only learn of the patches on the same day they are released to the Android Open Source Project (AOSP), meaning there will be a lag before it can distribute them.\nImage copyright\nGetty Images\nImage caption\nHuawei has promised to continue providing security updates for its smartphones\nThat could theoretically result in a situation in which a serious flaw is revealed and Huawei\'s devices\nremain exposed for several days or weeks.How about new handsets?New phones will not be certified, and as a consequence will not be able to have Google Mobile Services (GMS) pre-installed.This includes a suite of Google\'s own apps including:\nthe Play stores for apps, music and other media\nGoogle Photos\nYouTube\nGoogle Maps\nGoogle Drive cloud storage\nGoogle Duo video calls\nSome of these services will still be accessible via the web, but many would find that less convenient.The loss will not have much impact on China-based users, who are already blocked from accessing most of Google\'s facilities. But elsewhere, it could be a deal-breaker for many consumers.They would still be able to install third-party apps via alternative stores or a process known as side-loading.But Google prevents its own apps being installed on uncertified devices.Furthermore, losing access to GMS also means that third-party developers would not be able to tap into Google\'s application programming interfaces (APIs) on new devices.The consequences would be that their apps could lose some functions.\nImage copyright\nGoogle\nImage caption\nHuawei would be unable to install the GMS suite of apps on its forthcoming phones\n"Let\'s say an app wants to send a notification to your device," Mishaal Rahman, editor-in-chief of the news site XDA-developers.com, explained to the BBC."There\'s a really, really good chance that it\'s using Google Play Services for its push notification service. So any apps - even Twitter - could stop working with push notifications."Another example, he added, would be the loss of Casting, a facility that allows handsets to wirelessly stream audio and video to a TV or other equipment via a tap of an icon.What about future releases of Android?There has already been a lot of speculation that Huawei devices might be stuck with the current version of Android.But Mr Rahman believes that is unlikely to be the case since the next version - Android Q - will also be open source and Google has already shared most of the source code with Huawei and other partners.However, he added that things could be more tricky for the subsequent release - Android R - in 2020."What happens is that Google\'s top partners - which includes companies like Huawei and Samsung - get early access to the preview code many months before the public beta release," he explained."That gives them a big head-start on adapting their own software releases."The impact on Huawei would be that it would lose several months of development time."Moreover, Mr Rahman added, even if the Chinese company was willing to accept it could only offer the operating system much later than its competitors, it would also face a marketing nightmare."Android is actually a brand, and in order to use it your software must [be certified]," he explained."So, even if Huawei continues to sell devices using the open source code, it cannot legally call its devices Android."So what is the alternative?Huawei told the BBC it would prefer to work with Android, but has created a new operating system as a Plan B"We have been making plans for this possible outcome - but it hasn\'t happened yet," Jeremy Thompson, Huawei\'s UK executive vice president said."We have a parallel programme in place to develop an alternative… which we think will delight our customers."In the short-term it\'s not good news for Huawei, but I think we can manage that."\nImage copyright\nGetty Images\nImage caption\nHuawei\'s consumer business chief Richard Yu has also confirmed it has developed an alternative to Android\nIn China, that might not be too disruptive a move, thanks to the fact that device-owners spend much of their time within WeChat - a platform that allows third-party apps to run within it. Furthermore, other developers are likely to be put under pressure to quickly release versions of their stand-alone apps for the new operating system.But elsewhere the move could be highly problematic."Whatever they have cooked up is dead in the water," claimed Mr Rahman."The critical part of success with a mobile OS is the number of apps available on the market."And besides Apple\'s iOS, Android has the biggest developer platform."\nRelated TopicsGoogleMobile phonesHuaweiAndroid\nShare this story\nAbout\xa0sharing\nEmail\nFacebook\nMessenger\nMessenger\nTwitter\nPinterest\nWhatsApp\nLinkedIn\nMore on this story\nHuawei\'s use of Android restricted by Google\n20 May 2019\nTop Stories\nJavid knocked out of Tory leadership contest\nBoris Johnson leads the race to be next Tory leader while Michael Gove overtakes Jeremy Hunt to move into second place.\n20 June 2019\nTory leadership race final ballot\n19 June 2019\nAbuse claims \'horrendous\' says former MP\n20 June 2019\nFeatures\nHow my sleepy hometown became a violent crime hotspot\nWhere giving vaccines can get you killed\nVideo\nChina\'s vanishing beards and mosques\nThe cafe where customers don\'t have to pay\nThe fake minister in a silicone mask who stole millions\nBrexit: Where do Conservative leadership candidates stand?\nVideo\nHow a four-day week has changed our lives\nWhy it\'s so hard to stop a cult\nVideo\nFighting vaccine fears in the UK\nElsewhere on the BBC\nEqual Playing Field\nBreaking world records to get women into football\nFull article Equal Playing Field\nDaily news briefing direct to your inbox\nSign up for our newsletter\nFull article Daily news briefing direct to your inbox\nWhy you can trust BBC News\nBBC News Navigation\nSections\nHome\nUK\nUK Home\nEngland\nN.

  'Backed by LG, AmazeVR is hoping to resurrect virtual reality’s consumer dreams – TechCrunch\nBacked by LG, AmazeVR is hoping to resurrect virtual reality’s consumer dreams\nJonathan Shieber\n@jshieber\n/\n1 month\nFor more than 100 years, entrepreneurs have come to Hollywood to try their luck in the dream factory and build an empire in the business of storytelling.\nPropelled by new technologies, new businessmen have been landing in Los Angeles since the invention of the nickelodeon to create a studio that would dominate popular entertainment. Over the past five years, virtual reality was the latest new thing to make or break fortunes, and the founding team behind the Korean company AmazeVR are the latest would-be dream-makers to take their turn spinning the wheel for Hollywood fortunes.\nDespite billions of dollars in investment, and a sustained marketing push from some of the biggest names in the technology industry, virtual reality still doesn’t register with most regular consumers.\nBut technology companies keep pushing it, driven in part by a belief that maybe this time the next advancement in hardware and services will convince consumers to strap a headset onto their face and stay for a while in a virtual world.\nOculus Quest and Rift S now shipping\nThere are significant economic reasons for companies to persist. Sales of headsets in the fourth quarter of 2018 topped 1 million for the first time, and new, low-cost all-in-one models may further move the needle on adoption. Hardware makers have invested billions to improve the technology, and they’d like that money to not go to waste. At the same time, networking companies are spending billions to roll out new, high-speed data networks, and they need new data-hungry features (like virtual reality) to make a compelling case for consumers to upgrade to the newer, more expensive networking plans.\nSitting at the intersection of these two market forces are companies like AmazeVR,\nwhich is hoping to beat the odds.\nFounded by a team of ace Korean technologists who won fame and fortune as early executives of the multi-billion-dollar messaging service Kakao\n(it’s the Korean equivalent of WhatsApp or WeChat), AmazeVR is hoping it can succeed in a marketplace littered with production studios like Baobab Studios, Here Be Dragons, The Virtual Reality Company and others.\nThe company was formed and financed with $6.3 million from its founding team of Kakao co-founder and co-chief executive, JB Lee, who serves as AmazeVR’s chief product officer; its head of strategy, Steve Lee, AmazeVR’s chief executive; Jeremy Nam, the chief technology officer at AmazeVR and the former senior software engineer of Kakao; and finally, Steve Koo, who led KakaoTalk’s messaging team and is now head of engineering at AmazeVR.\n“What we saw as the problem is the content creation itself,” says Lee.\nEncouraged by the potential uptake of the Oculus Go and spurred on by $7 million in funding led by\xa0Mirae Asset Group, with participation from strategic investors including LG Technology Ventures, Timewise Investment and Smilegate Investment, AmazeVR is looking to plant a flag in Hollywood to encourage producers and content creators to use its platform and get a significant library of content up and running.\nFor LG, it’s strategically important to get some applications up on its newly launched 5G subscription network back in Korea, and AmazeVR is already rolling up new content for its VR platform.\nIn fact, AmazeVR has already partnered with LG U+, the telecommunications network arm of LG, to produce virtual reality content. LG U+ will host AmazeVR content on its service, using the company’s proprietary content generation tools to make VR production easier as it looks to roll out 1,500 new pieces of virtual reality “experiences.”\nAmazeVR sells its content as a $7 per-month subscription, with three-month bundles for $18 and six-month bundles for $24. So far, they’ve got more than 1,000 subscribers and expect to add more as consumers start opening their wallets to pick up more devices. The company already has 20 interactive virtual reality experiences available and is in Los Angeles to connect with top talent for additional productions, the company said.\n“We believe cloud-based VR is the future, and AmazeVR has developed elegant technology that enables users to create and share interactive content very easily,” said Dong-Su Kim, CEO of LG Technology Ventures, in a statement. “We are incredibly excited about how the AmazeVR platform will enable innovative, quality content to be generated at unprecedented scale and speed.”\nAmazeVR uses a proprietary back end to stitch 360-degree video and provide editing and production tools for content creators in addition to building its own cameras for video capture, the company said.\nAs it builds out its library, AmazeVR is giving video creators a cut of the sales from the company’s subscriptions and individual downloads of their virtual reality experiences.\n“We see no reason that VR content shouldn’t be compelling enough to support a Netflix model. To get there, we must devise mechanisms to inspire, assist and reward content creators,” said Steve Lee, CEO of AmazeVR. “Our approach, commitment to quality, industry-leading technology and strategic investors provide a path forward to make VR/AR the next great frontier for entertainment and personal displays.”',
  'Robin picks up $20 million Series B to optimize the office – TechCrunch\nRobin picks up $20 million Series B to optimize the office\nJordan Crook\n@jordanrcrook\n/\n1 month\nRobin Powered, a startup looking to help offices run better, has today announced the close of a $20 million Series B funding. The round was led by Tola Capital, with existing investors Accomplice and FirstMark participating in the round, along with a new strategic Allegion Ventures.\nRobin\nstarted as part of an agency called One Mighty Roar, where Robin Powered co-founder Sam Dunn and his two co-founders built out RFID and beacon tech for clients’ live events. In 2014, they spun out the tech as Robin and tweaked the focus on the modern office.\nThe office stands to be one of the least efficient pieces of any business. As a company grows, or even if it doesn’t, it’s particularly difficult to understand the “inventory” of the office and how it is used by workers throughout the day.\n“Before, if I asked you what you needed out of your next office, you might go around and survey employees or hire an architecture firm,” said Dunn. “I heard a story where a manager sent around an intern every Thursday at 3pm to talk to employees about the office, and that was one of two pieces of information handed over to the architecture firm. At the end of the day, it’s hard to know if there’s a shortage of meeting rooms, or teleconference-enabled rooms, or collaborative workspaces.”\nThat’s where Robin comes in. Robin hooks into Google Calendar and Outlook to help employees get a sense of what meeting rooms and activity spaces are available in the office, complete with tablet signage out front. Meetings are the starting point for Robin, but the company can also offer tools for seating charts and office maps, as well as insights. The company wants to offer insights about how the space in this or that office is being used — what they lack and what they have too much of.\nRobin charges its clients per room ($300) and per desk ($24 – $60). The hope is to build out the same technological backbone for clients’ offices as WeWork provides alongside its physical space, giving every business the opportunity to optimize one of their biggest investments: the office itself.\nRobin has raised a total of $30 million.',
  'With foldable phones in limbo, foldable display laptops are on the horizon – TechCrunch\nWith foldable phones in limbo, foldable display laptops are on the horizon\nBrian Heater\n@bheater\n/\n1 month\nWith the Galaxy Fold and Huawei Mate X currently in limbo for very different reasons, PC makers are apparently jumping at the chance to make their own foldable display ambitions known. It’s been clear, of course, for as long as flexible screens have been a viable technology, that hardware manufacturers would be experimenting with any and all form factors. In just the past week, two key players have talked up their plans for how it might be utilized on the PC front.\nLast week, Lenovo showed off a prototype ThinkPad X1. The company’s been no stranger to experimental convertibles, and utilizing a foldable display could further blur the line been tablets and PCs. The technology allows for a large screen in a compact form factor. Here it’s 13.3 inches that can be collapsed into half the size, making it a lot easier to take with you.\nIt’s a slick prototype, and obviously folding form factors are already the standard in the laptop world. But like Lenovo’s past attempts at dual-screen devices, the on-screen removes the tactile keyboard, one of the biggest pain points in moving consumers away from more traditional laptops. Perhaps that’s something that could be addressed with the sorts of overlays provided by companies like Sensel.\nDell, too, recently told Gizmodo that it’s experimenting with a similar form factor. No surprise on that front, really. One expects that any PC maker worth its weight in netbooks is, at the very least, playing around with the concept as we speak.\nAll of this is complicated by the fact that the foldable phone category has been plagued with issues — though not necessarily the ones most people predicted. Samsung indefinitely pushed back the launch date of the Galaxy Fold after several reviewers ran into issues with their units.\nWe’re still waiting for official news on that front. Huawei, meanwhile, had a wrench thrown into its stratospheric ascendancy when the company was blacklisted by the Trump White House, leaving aspects of its future in jeopardy.\nNeither of these are direct indictments of the concept — though Samsung’s model certainly failed in real-world testing. For that reason, it’s probably safe to say that the jury’s still out on consumer demand, though many of the major concerns, including pricing, would likely carry over to the PC category.',
  'China overtakes US in smart speaker market share – TechCrunch\nChina overtakes US in smart speaker market share\nSarah Perez\n@sarahintampa\n/\n1 month\nThe U.S. no longer leads the smart speaker market, according to new data from Canalys out this morning, which found China’s smart speaker shipments grew by 500% in Q1 2019 to overtake the U.S. and achieve a 51% market share.\nThe firm said shipments in China reached 10.6 million units, which was driven by “festive promotions.”\nMore specifically, Baidu\nhad a huge quarter thanks to an exclusive sponsorship deal with China’s national TV channel, CCTV, on its New Year’s Gala on Chinese New Year’s Eve — one of the biggest entertainment shows in terms of viewer numbers. This promotion prompted users to download the Baidu app, which distributed more than 100 million coupons to an audience of 1.2 billion during the show, and drove awareness around the brand’s smart speakers, Canalys says.\nIn Q1, Baidu shipped 3.3 million speakers — putting it in third place behind Amazon’s\n4.6 million and Google’s\n3.5 million. Alibaba and Xiaomi followed, each with 3.2 million shipments, also driven by Chinese New Year promotions.\n“The lightning fast development in China is largely driven by vendors pouring in large amounts of capital to achieve dominant share quickly,” noted Nicole Peng, VP of Mobility at Canalys, in a statement. “This strategy is favoured by internet service providers like Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent who are used to spending billions on traffic acquisition and know how to reach critical installed base fast.”\nOther brands, combined, accounted for a further 2.9 million shipments. That includes Apple’s\nHomePod, whose market share was so small it got wrapped into this “Others” section instead of being broken out on its own.\nWith 10.6 million units, China topped the U.S. (which had 5 million units shipped) and brought its market share up to 51%, while the U.S. dropped from 44% in Q4 2018 to 24% in Q1 2019.\nOverall, the global smart speaker market returned to triple-digit annual growth of 131% in the quarter, reaching 20.7 million total Q1 shipments — up from just 9 million in the first quarter of 2018.',

  'Ford will slash 7,000 salaried jobs by August – TechCrunch\nFord will slash 7,000 salaried jobs by August\nKirsten Korosec\n1 month\nFord Motor is laying off 7,000 salaried employees as part of CEO Jim Hackett’s\nrestructuring plan to reduce bureaucracy, cut costs and turn the automaker into a more agile company prepared for a future that extends beyond its traditional business of producing and selling cars and trucks.\nThe cuts represent about 10% of the automaker’s salaried employees. Some buyouts and layoffs have already occurred, according to an email sent to employees by Hackett. The contents of the email were initially reported by the WSJ. TechCrunch has since reviewed the email.\nSome 1,500 employees opted for voluntary buyouts, which occurred in November 2018, according to a spokesperson. Ford expects to complete the restructuring efforts by August globally. Cuts affecting Ford’s North American workforce will be complete by June, a Ford spokesperson told TechCrunch.\nThis cuts will result in annual savings of about $600 million, Hackett said in the email. “We also made significant progress in eliminating bureaucracy, speeding up decision making and driving empowerment as part of this redesign,” he wrote.\nThe layoffs were anticipated by employees. Ford informed employees last October that it would be restructuring the company, a move that would likely result in layoffs and voluntary buyouts.\nThe reorganization is part of a broader strategy to prepare for a future with autonomous vehicle technology, electrification and unconventional ownership models.\nThe restructuring plan is focused on making the company more agile and less bureaucratic. Each business went through a “Smart Redesign” process, according to Hackett’s email, which notes that 1,000 employees were involved in this activity.\nFord previously announced it would spend $11 billion to add 16 all-electric vehicles within its global portfolio of 40 electrified vehicles through 2022. At the heart of the company’s electrification effort is its Corktown project, a massive 1.2 million-square-foot space dedicated to its electric and autonomous vehicles businesses.\nThe goal of Corktown is to create a “mobility corridor” — Ford’s version of its own Sand Hill Road in Silicon Valley — that ties hubs of research, testing and development in the academic hub of Ann Arbor to Ford’s Dearborn headquarters, and finally to Detroit.\nLast year, Hackett revealed several other techcentric plans for the automaker that included the introduction of an open cloud-based platform for cities to use, a partnership with Qualcomm for Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything, or C-V2X, a term that means two-way communication with stoplights, signs and other city infrastructure.',
  'MIT and US Air Force team up to launch AI accelerator – TechCrunch\nMIT and US Air Force team up to launch AI accelerator\nDanny Crichton\n1 month\nThe Pentagon is one of the largest technology customers in the world, purchasing everything from F-35 planes (roughly $90 million each) to cloud services (the JEDI contract was $10 billion). Despite outlaying hundreds of billions of dollars for acquisitions though, the Defense Department has struggled to push nascent technologies from startups through its punishing procurement process.\nThe department launched the Defense Innovation Unit a few years back as a way to connect startups into the defense world. Now, the military has decided to work even earlier to ensure that the next generation of startups can equip the military with the latest technology.\nCambridge, Mass.-based MIT and the U.S. Air Force announced today they are teaming up to launch a new accelerator focused on artificial intelligence applications, with the Air Force committed to investing $15 million into roughly 10 MIT research projects per year. The accelerator will be called the MIT-Air Force AI Accelerator (clearly, the Pentagon hasn’t gotten better at naming things).\nThe accelerator will be housed on campus at MIT’s new computing college, which received a $1 billion commitment last year, including $350 million from Stephen A. Schwarzman. The college is expected to officially launch later this fall.\nThis will not be the Air Force’s first foray into accelerators. The service also built out an accelerator with Techstars that is directly targeted at solving the Air Force’s problems. An MIT spokesperson said that the Techstars accelerator, which is also based in Boston, will remain independent of the MIT accelerator.\nWhile MIT has had close relationships with the military going back decades, concerns have increased among some technologists about working on frontier tech like artificial intelligence and drones within a military context, especially an offensive military context. Last year, employees at Google blocked the tech giant from signing a cloud agreement with the Pentagon related to Project Maven, which would have applied AI and “algorithms” to battlefield applications.\nMaria Zuber, a professor of geophysics and MIT’s Vice President for Research, told TechCrunch that “MIT does not do weapons research.” She also said that “Only those researchers who want to participate will do so.

Count upon that."\nThere are still four seats yet to be declared.\nThe Liberal Party is leading in two of those seats - Bass in Tasmania and Macquarie in New South Wales - while Labor has a narrow lead in Cowan, West Australia, and in Lilley in Brisbane.The result represents a comfortable increase from the coalition\'s standing prior to the election, where it had fallen into minority government, relying on the support of independents.\nHow Australia\'s PM forged a \'miracle\' win\nThe election as it happened\nMorrison: Australia\'s conservative pragmatist\nOn Tuesday, the seat of Chisholm in Victoria was declared for Liberal candidate Gladys Liu, taking the government over the 76-seat threshold.Ms Liu is the first Chinese-Australian ever to be elected to the lower house.\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device\nMedia captionGladys Liu and Jennifer Yang squared off to make history in Australia - the BBC met them on the campaign trail\nWhy was this outcome such a surprise?For more than a year, consecutive opinion polls had shown Labor ahead of the government.The view was that the government\'s image had been damaged by successive leadership challenges and the chaotic ousting of Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull last year, as well as a string of parliamentary scandals.Mr Morrison, who had only been leader for nine months, went into Saturday\'s vote as the underdog.\nImage copyright\nGetty Images\nImage caption\nScott Morrison waves to the crowd while celebrating his victory at a rugby league match in Sydney on Sunday\nHe campaigned primarily on economic issues, often doing so alone and painting the election as a choice between himself and Mr Shorten.Labor campaigned on a promise to "stop the chaos" and introduce major changes to climate and economic policy.\nThe vote that spans outback to Antarctica\n10 things to know about Australia\'s election\nBut ultimately that failed to appeal to voters and the conservative coalition romped home, collecting seats from Labor with a national 0.5% swing towards it."I\'ve always believed in miracles," Mr Morrison told supporters in his victory speech on Saturday.What were the biggest upsets?Former Prime Minister Tony Abbott lost his safe seat to an independent candidate, Zali Steggall, ending his 25-year hold on the wealthy Sydney electorate.However, that was the only real loss for the coalition and it was Labor who suffered the biggest upsets.The conservatives unexpectedly swept the state of Queensland, where a dozen marginal seats for the House of Representatives were being closely watched.\nThis gutted Labor\'s vote, reducing the party to just five or six seats of the 30 in the state.\nThe Senate is still keyHywel Griffith, BBC News, CanberraAfter limping through the last few months as a minority government, suffering embarrassing defeats and failing to get legislation through, suddenly the coalition has been born again. These numbers may not look huge, but they will make a big difference to how Scott Morrison can approach parliament. Having a majority means he won\'t have to garner the favour of cross-benchers nor offer concessions to his opponents. In theory, there should be far less fire-fighting and far more stable government. Of course, in practice the two-tier system means legislation still needs to get through the Senate where the coalition isn\'t on course for a majority. And remember, if Australian politics has taught us anything, it is to expect the unexpected - just when it looks like we\'re in calm waters often another storm can blow in.\nSorry, your browser cannot display this map\nWhat will Scott Morrison\'s government look like?Mr Morrison has not yet revealed his cabinet. However it will feature many new faces because several Liberal frontbenchers resigned before the election.The prime minister had promised to pass tax cuts immediately, but he now forecasts delays due to post-election red tape. He has articulated some other priorities - including an upgrade to a coal plant, and extra funding for non-government schools. However a broader agenda is yet to be defined.How Australia is changing - in 11 chartsWhat will happen to Labor?Much of the post-election analysis has focused on the decline in the party\'s traditional blue-collar base, and whether its package of reforms was too ambitious.Having now lost two consecutive elections, Mr Shorten has stepped aside as the party seeks to remodel itself under a new leader.\nImage copyright\nEPA\nImage caption\nBill Shorten, pictured with his wife Chloe, will make way for a new Labor leader\nAnthony Albanese, who vied for the leadership in 2013 against Mr Shorten, says he will run for the role. Frontbencher Jim Chalmers is also considering a run, but other contenders Chris Bowen and Joel Fitzgibbon withdrew from the race on Wednesday.Party deputy Tanya Plibersek, who was another favourite, said on Monday she would not join the contest because of family reasons.\nRelated TopicsAustralia election 2019AustraliaScott Morrison\nShare this story\nAbout\xa0sharing\nEmail\nFacebook\nMessenger\nMessenger\nTwitter\nPinterest\nWhatsApp\nLinkedIn\nMore on this story\nScott Morrison: How Australia\'s PM built a \'miracle\' election win\n19 May 2019\n2019 Australia election: As it happened\n18 May 2019\n2019 election: Why politics is toxic for Australia’s women\n16 May 2019\n2019 Australia election in 11 charts\n13 May 2019\nAustralia election 2019: The most remote polling stations\n14 May 2019\nWhy climate \'paralysis\' looms over Australia\'s election\n5 May 2019\nTop Stories\nJavid knocked out of Tory leadership contest\nBoris Johnson leads the race to be next Tory leader while Michael Gove overtakes Jeremy Hunt to move into second place.\n20 June 2019\nTory leadership race final ballot\n19 June 2019\nAbuse claims \'horrendous\' says former MP\n20 June 2019\nFeatures\nHow my sleepy hometown became a violent crime hotspot\nWhere giving vaccines can get you killed\nVideo\nChina\'s vanishing beards and mosques\nThe cafe where customers don\'t have to pay\nThe fake minister in a silicone mask who stole millions\nBrexit: Where do Conservative leadership candidates stand?\nVideo\nHow a four-day week has changed our lives\nWhy it\'s so hard to stop a cult\nVideo\nFighting vaccine fears in the UK\nElsewhere on the BBC\nEqual Playing Field\nBreaking world records to get women into football\nFull article Equal Playing Field\nDaily news briefing direct to your inbox\nSign up for our newsletter\nFull article Daily news briefing direct to your inbox\nWhy you can trust BBC News\nBBC News Navigation\nWorld\nSections\nAfrica\nAsia\nAustralia\nselected\nEurope\nLatin America\nMiddle East\nUS & Canada\nHome\nUK\nUK Home\nEngland\nN.

"Never threaten the United States again!"Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif tweeted in response that such "genocidal taunts won\'t \'end Iran\'".The US has deployed additional warships and planes to the Gulf in recent days.But Mr Trump\'s tweet marks a shift in tone after recent attempts to downplay the possibility of military conflict.\nIn an interview with Fox News broadcast on Sunday, the president vowed that he would not let Iran develop nuclear weapons but said he did not want a conflict. "I\'m not somebody that wants to go into war, because war hurts economies, war kills people most importantly - by far most importantly," he said.\nIs the United States heading for war with Iran?\nWhy the WhatsApp spies may have eyes on Iran\nIran travel warning for dual nationals\nIran has also moved to talk down concerns over the escalating tensions. On Saturday, its foreign minister insisted there was no appetite for war."There will not be a war since neither we want a war nor does anyone have the illusion they can confront Iran in the region," Mr Zarif told state news agency Irna.On Monday he dismissed Mr Trump\'s tweet, saying the president "hopes to achieve what Alexander [the Great], Genghis [Khan] & other aggressors failed to do.""Iranians have stood tall for millennia while aggressors all gone. #EconomicTerrorism & genocidal taunts won\'t \'end Iran\'," he added. "#NeverThreatenAnIranian. Try respect—it works!"\nPresident Trump, after appearing to dial down the tensions with Iran, has now seemingly threatened catastrophic consequences if there is any attack against US interests or facilities.It underscores the mercurial approach of the US president to world affairs - restraint one moment and bluster the next. Such an approach is hugely destabilising and could contribute to Tehran misjudging US intentions.All of the ingredients for a confrontation are there: a lack of clarity in the US approach; the potential desire by Iran to push matters to the brink; and a series of incidents in the region itself (the recent sabotage against a small number of oil tankers and the rocket attack near the US compound in Baghdad) which demonstrate that there are elements on the ground eager to inflame tensions and test the US administration\'s resolve.\nWhy are there tensions?The latest frictions come after Iran suspended its commitments under the 2015 international nuclear deal, and threatened to resume production of enriched uranium which is used to make reactor fuel and nuclear weapons.The deal aimed to cut sanctions on Iran in exchange for an end to its nuclear programme, but the US unilaterally withdrew from the agreement last year.Calling the deal "defective", Mr Trump then re-imposed sanctions.\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device\nMedia captionThe BBC’s Paul Adams looks at the recent developments behind the US-Iran tensions\nTehran has allegedly placed missiles on boats in the Gulf, and US investigators reportedly believe the country damaged four tankers off the coast of the United Arab Emirates, claims Iran has denied.What\'s the latest in the Gulf?On Sunday, the Iraqi military said a rocket had been fired into Baghdad\'s heavily-fortified Green Zone, which houses government buildings and foreign embassies.It reportedly hit an abandoned building near to the US embassy. There were no casualties and it is not yet clear who was behind the attack.A State Department spokesman however said the US will hold Iran responsible "if any such attacks are conducted by its proxy militia forces".Mr Trump\'s threats on Twitter came hours after the first reports of the rocket attack.\nThe Iran nuclear crisis in 300 words\nPresident Trump \'behaving like a mafia boss\'\nIn recent days, the US has deployed the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier to the region and reportedly drawn up plans to send 120,000 troops to the Middle East.Diplomatic staff have been ordered to leave Iraq, and the US military have raised the threat level in the region because of alleged intelligence about Iran-backed forces - contradicting a British general who had said there was "no increased threat".Dutch and German soldiers said they had suspended their military training programmes in the country.Separately, Saudi Arabia accused Tehran of a drone attack on a pipeline on Friday. It alleged that Houthi rebels in Yemen conducted the strike on Iran\'s orders. A state-aligned Saudi newspaper called for the US to launch attacks on the country.Iran denies the allegations.\nRelated TopicsIranDonald TrumpUnited StatesIran-US relations\nShare this story\nAbout\xa0sharing\nEmail\nFacebook\nMessenger\nMessenger\nTwitter\nPinterest\nWhatsApp\nLinkedIn\nMore on this story\nIran-US tensions: \'There will be no war\', says Zarif\n18 May 2019\nPresident Donald Trump \'does not want war with Iran\'\n17 May 2019\nForeign Office warns against Iran travel for British-Iranians\n17 May 2019\nUS pulls \'non-emergency staff\' from Iraq as Iran tensions mount\n15 May 2019\nUS \'blames Iran\' for damage to tankers in Gulf of Oman\n14 May 2019\nIran nuclear crisis in 300 words\n11 June 2019\nTop Stories\nJavid knocked out of Tory leadership contest\nBoris Johnson leads the race to be next Tory leader while Michael Gove overtakes Jeremy Hunt to move into second place.\n20 June 2019\nTory leadership race final ballot\n19 June 2019\nAbuse claims \'horrendous\' says former MP\n20 June 2019\nFeatures\nHow my sleepy hometown became a violent crime hotspot\nWhere giving vaccines can get you killed\nVideo\nChina\'s vanishing beards and mosques\nThe cafe where customers don\'t have to pay\nThe fake minister in a silicone mask who stole millions\nBrexit: Where do Conservative leadership candidates stand?\nVideo\nHow a four-day week has changed our lives\nWhy it\'s so hard to stop a cult\nVideo\nFighting vaccine fears in the UK\nElsewhere on the BBC\nEqual Playing Field\nBreaking world records to get women into football\nFull article Equal Playing Field\nDaily news briefing direct to your inbox\nSign up for our newsletter\nFull article Daily news briefing direct to your inbox\nWhy you can trust BBC News\nBBC News Navigation\nUS & Canada\nHome\nUK\nUK Home\nEngland\nN.

I couldn\'t believe it. She absolutely loves it."My parents are very supportive. I think if I did any sport they\'d be on the bandwagon. My mum spent hours and hours driving me to games and practice and never complained."The mother-daughter duo share a love of netball which dates back to the younger Housby\'s school days, when they played on the same team, albeit on the opposite side of the court.Housby\'s mum, Gill, was present on the Gold Coast to witness her daughter repeat the same feat from four years earlier, when Helen helped secure the 2014 Netball Superleague title for former side Manchester Thunder when she was just 19.Her performance in that game won her her first England cap at the Glasgow Commonwealth Games later that summer. Another chapter in her England career will be written this summer if, as expected, she is named in the World Cup squad for the tournament being held in Liverpool.\nHelen Housby is lifted up by her team-mates after scoring the winning goal in the dying seconds of the 2014 Superleague Grand Final - they won their first title since then at the weekendAs a child who excelled at most sports, her ability and athleticism could have landed her a spot in a team coached by another famous Neville, Tracey\'s twin brother Phil, the manager of the England football team. "If I wasn\'t a netballer, I think I\'d be some other athlete as it\'s something I love and enjoy. I\'d probably be a footballer, as I also love football," said Housby, a big Manchester United fan.Housby is now in her third season with Sydney-based NSW Swifts and has embraced the Australian lifestyle - which is a stark contrast to her upbringing on a rural farm in Cumbria."Heading out to the beaches is something I love doing here and the weather is great. I make sure I stock up on gravy in the English aisles in the supermarket, though!"Every team going to the World Cup will want to beat England on home soil -\nI think everyone will be gunning for usHelen HousbyThe shooter says the facilities in Australia are "amazing" thanks to the sport being 100% professional. Most players in the British Superleague, by contrast, are part-time."We have a dedicated netball centre in the Olympic Park in Sydney, they are few and far between back in England," says Housby. "We see the staff and our girls every day, sometimes twice a day, for hours on end, it\'s very high performance and the best place to be to get the best out of yourself."In the Superleague [with Thunder] I would see my team on Tuesday and Thursday, and did solo weight sessions - it\'s very different out here. I feel good, I\'m in good shape."I saw England players, like Jo Harten, come back completely different players from playing overseas and I guess I wanted that lifestyle and to make myself a better netball player- this is the best place to be."Ama Agbeze: England captain \'frustrated\' but \'at peace\' with World Cup omissionThere\'s not much off-season to enjoy, however, with Housby selected for two England Quad Series squads and for Tests against Jamaica and Uganda since finishing last season\'s league campaign in August."It is difficult to balance an international and domestic season, because it\'s pretty much non-stop," Housby adds."You have to be very careful where you put the rest in, the long flights aren\'t easy on the body, but we handle it pretty well and there\'s a really professional approach."\nHousby\'s experience on the Gold Coast (left) was in complete contrast to her debut international tournament with the Roses aged 19, after England missed out on a medal at Glasgow 2014Looking to the World Cup, which will be the second for Housby if she is named in Neville\'s 12-player squad, the former Zoology student said: "I think every team going to the World Cup will want to beat England on home soil -\nI think everyone will be gunning for us."Defending champions Australia have a point to prove. But for us, we have to not get complacent."I don\'t feel like there\'s any pressure, they\'re still technically ranked number one in the world. We just need to embrace the atmosphere and home crowd."Psychological preparation will be key and Housby will draw on the ground work she has put in with the Swifts.Housby thrives under the increased media presence and worldwide recognition of her sport, and relishes the "favourites" tag England now find themselves wearing.On England winning both Team of the Year and Moment of the Year at the BBC Sports Personality of the Year awards 2018, Housby added: "At the ceremony we were fortunate to meet Billie Jean King who is amazing with everything she has done for women\'s sport. I think she paved the way for women like us. "And it was so good to finally get women\'s teams winning those awards. When I was growing up, most of my idols were male because they dominated the awards."It was pretty special to know that there could be young girls looking up to us winning those awards."\'Netball made me the person I was before depression\'BBC Sport has launched #ChangeTheGame this summer to showcase female athletes in a way they never have been before.

Sound familiar? During the 2016 US presidential campaign, Donald Trump appeared at almost as many. The BBC\'s Rajini Vaidyanathan looks at how the cult of personality politics is similar to both men.On a hot and dusty evening in India\'s capital Delhi, crowds are gathering at an outdoor ground called the Ramlila Maidan. Larger than life cardboard cut-outs of PM Narendra Modi line the route, along a busy arterial road. Outside the ground a brass band - the sort usually seen at Indian weddings - blasts out versions of Bollywood songs, as hordes of supporters of India\'s ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) line up to enter. Some people clap and dance, others chant "Modi, Modi".\nThe merchandise sellers spring up on you from nowhere. "Would you like a BJP umbrella?" a man asks me, as he unfurls one to reveal its green and orange party colours.This sort of political hysteria reminds me of the energy and passion I witnessed in 2016 at rallies for Donald Trump. Mr Trump\'s campaign was built on the promise of "Making America Great Again"; for BJP supporters here it\'s all about "NaMo Again" - NaMo being the moniker given to Mr Modi. Arun Bansal, 27, is wearing a "NaMo Again" T-shirt. "National security and Pakistan are the big issues this election," the BJP worker tells me.\nImage copyright\nGetty Images/BBC\nImage caption\nLike Trump merchandise, the Modi obsession has spawned a range of clothing\nIf the 2016 race in the US was characterised by Mr Trump\'s tough talk towards southern neighbour Mexico, then 2019 has in many ways been defined by Mr Modi\'s desire to show he is the strongman when it comes to relations with northern neighbour Pakistan. Just before we go inside the rally ground, I encounter the first of many Narendra Modi lookalikes. Atri, or "little Modi" as his parents call him, is only seven years old and he\'s been attending rallies since he was four. For a moment I have a flashback to an equally hot and humid evening in Florida where I\'d met multiple Trump lookalikes - complete with bright yellow wigs, fake tans and red ties. Here it\'s all about the white beard and glasses. "I like Mr Modi because he does good, he helps the poor and everyone else," says Atri, who has ambitions of becoming prime minister himself one day. Patriotic music is pumping as we enter the rally grounds, seats starting to fill up. Both leaders have a knack of making their base feel an unwavering sense of belonging.\nImage caption\nHarminder Singh Bhatia says he likes Mr Modi because he is a "strong leader"\nThe next level is clothing. At both rallies, the basic uniform starts with headgear. In America, it is the trademark red MAGA hats. Here, it is an orange hat with the words "NaMo Again" stamped on it. Harminder Singh Bhatia has arrived wearing a Narendra Modi waistcoat, its polyester finish shimmering in the evening light."I\'ve been to every one of his rallies in this area, since he became prime minister," he tells me excitedly. "He\'s hardworking, he cares about the country. I like him because he\'s a strong leader."\nIndia votes 2019\nNarendra Modi: The man who wants 900m votes\nIndia\'s Muslims fear for their future under Narendra Modi\nA really simple guide to India\'s general election\nAs the ground fills up, and the sun begins to set, I\'m struck by how many women are in the crowd, like Mridula Aneja, a Sanskrit teacher from Delhi who is at her third Modi rally.The warm-up acts take to the stage - candidates and party members whip up the crowd ahead of the headliner. Just like super fans at a rock concert, political groupies like to outdo each other with their devotion.All the while I\'m getting Twitter notifications from Narendra Modi. Mr Modi, like Mr Trump, uses social media to directly talk to his base, and so as the BJP leader makes his journey to the rally, my phone is pinging with alerts. "Prime Minister Modi and I are world leaders in social media." Mr Trump said when the pair met at the White House in 2017. President Trump has 60.4 million followers - PM Modi isn\'t too far behind with 47.3 million.\nImage copyright\nBBC/Getty Images\nImage caption\nAtri (pictured left), or "little Modi", is seven years old and he\'s been attending rallies since he was four\nAs I glance up from my phone, another Modi lookalike walks past and I do a double take.Ranveer Dhiyam is a retired government official who now travels from rally to rally. "Five hundred people have asked me for a selfie this election," he tells me proudly. I decide to make it 501. This is the closest I\'ve come to the man himself, if you can even count it. Just like Mr Trump, Mr Modi is notoriously choosy about who he grants interviews to, opting for his preferred outlets, who are more sympathetic and less challenging to the BJP. The same can be said of President Trump, whose outlet of choice is Fox News. As the crowd falls briefly silent, we are told (the real) Mr Modi is on his way.\nImage caption\nThe BBC crew with Ranveer Dhiyam\nMinutes later, the prime minister is introduced on stage as the emcee calls on everyone to make a noise so loud it\'s "an airstrike of claps"- a reference to the airstrikes India says it carried out inside Pakistani territory earlier this year.They do much more than that - whooping, screeching, whipping out mobile phones as they chant "Modi, Modi" in unison. "Bharat mata ki jai (victory for mother India)", Mr Modi says, as he kicks off his speech.\nOnce again I\'m having a 2016 flashback to choruses of "USA, USA".In the pantomime style I\'ve witnessed at Trump rallies, Mr Modi, too, encourages audience interaction. "Should we not kill terrorists in their homes?" he asks. "Tell me, should we not?""No, we should," the crowd replies.\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device\nMedia captionIndia\'s elections: Why you should care\nMr Modi also devotes time to criticise his main opponent, Congress party leader Rahul Gandhi.Both him and Mr Trump present themselves as outsiders with contempt for those they see as the imperious ruling classes.\nBoth ran against members of political dynasties - Hillary Clinton, whose husband is a former president, and Mr Gandhi, the scion of the Nehru-Gandhi family.Mr Modi derides "the Khan Market gang" - a reference to one of Delhi\'s most exclusive areas, inhabited by the country\'s most privileged. Mr Trump, who\'d never held public office before, brands Washington\'s elite members of the so-called "swamp". "They want votes in the name of their ancestors but when I question the work their ancestors have done, and what they\'ve done to our country, they get irritated," Mr Modi says as hundreds roar in approval.He did not hold back in his attacks on the opposition and many felt he had sunk to a new low when he criticised his opponent\'s dead father. He described Rajiv Gandhi, a former prime minister who was assassinated in 1991, as "corrupt number one".\nImage copyright\nBBC/Getty Images\nImage caption\nFans of both Mr Trump and Mr Modi feel that the two politicians challenge the elite classes\nIt reminded me of similar insults Donald Trump directed at Senator John McCain, who lost his battle with cancer last year. Both Donald Trump and Narendra Modi pride themselves on being direct, but their speeches have sometimes descended into the distasteful. But for both sets of supporters, there\'s a broad acceptance that it doesn\'t matter if the lines of political civility are crossed - as long as the job is done. The cult of personality politics is what ties the two leaders. Their respective bases believe that personalities like Mr Trump and Mr Modi are ready to stand up for voices that are usually ignored by the ruling classes. "I really like him - there\'s such an attraction," Santosh, a mechanic from Delhi tells me, as he clutches his 18-month-old baby who is also dressed as the prime minister. "I\'m ready to skip a meal but I\'m not ready for anyone to disrespect our country - that\'s why I like Modi."You can follow @BBCRajiniV on TwitterAdditional reporting by Kunal Sehgal\nRelated TopicsNarendra ModiIndiaDonald TrumpIndia elections 2019\nShare this story\nAbout\xa0sharing\nEmail\nFacebook\nMessenger\nMessenger\nTwitter\nPinterest\nWhatsApp\nLinkedIn\nMore on this story\nA really simple guide to India’s general election\n8 April 2019\nIndia\'s Muslims fear for their future under Narendra Modi\n16 May 2019\nTop Stories\nJavid knocked out of Tory leadership contest\nBoris Johnson leads the race to be next Tory leader while Michael Gove overtakes Jeremy Hunt to move into second place.\n20 June 2019\nTory leadership race final ballot\n19 June 2019\nAbuse claims \'horrendous\' says former MP\n20 June 2019\nFeatures\nHow my sleepy hometown became a violent crime hotspot\nWhere giving vaccines can get you killed\nVideo\nChina\'s vanishing beards and mosques\nThe cafe where customers don\'t have to pay\nThe fake minister in a silicone mask who stole millions\nBrexit: Where do Conservative leadership candidates stand?\nVideo\nHow a four-day week has changed our lives\nWhy it\'s so hard to stop a cult\nVideo\nFighting vaccine fears in the UK\nElsewhere on the BBC\nEqual Playing Field\nBreaking world records to get women into football\nFull article Equal Playing Field\nDaily news briefing direct to your inbox\nSign up for our newsletter\nFull article Daily news briefing direct to your inbox\nWhy you can trust BBC News\nBBC News Navigation\nAsia\nSections\nAsia\nChina\nIndia\nselected\nHome\nUK\nUK Home\nEngland\nN.

There was no uniform experience, but over time, they were banned from having relationships with white people, excluded from education and types of employment, and some were sterilised, while others were taken to concentration camps.\'Disbelief and dismissiveness\'But their story has largely been untold - and it has taken Ms Asante 12 years to get her account of the period on to the big screen.\nImage copyright\nSpirit Entertainment\nImage caption\nAmandla Stenberg plays mixed-race teenager Leyna in Where Hands Touch\n"Often there\'s a form of disbelief, of questioning, sometimes even a dismissiveness of the difficult lives these people led," she told the BBC about the reaction she received from some when she spoke about her research for the film.The African-German community has its origins in the country\'s short-lived empire. Sailors, servants, students and entertainers from present-day Cameroon, Togo, Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi and Namibia came to Germany.\nOnce World War One broke out in 1914 this transient population became more settled, according to historian Robbie Aitken. And some African soldiers who fought for Germany in the war also settled there.But there was a second group whose presence went on to feed into the Nazis\' fear of racial mixing.As part of the treaty that was signed after Germany\'s defeat in World War One, French troops occupied the Rhineland area of western Germany.France used at least 20,000 soldiers from its African empire, mainly North and West Africa, to police the area, some of whom went on to have relationships with German women.Racist caricatures The derogatory term "Rhineland bastards" was coined in the 1920s to refer to the 600-800 mixed-race children who were the result of those relationships.The term spoke to some people\'s imagined fears of an impure race. Made-up stories and racist caricatures of sexually predatory African soldiers were circulated at the time, fuelling concern.\nImage copyright\nRobbie Aitken\nImage caption\nThe 1936 headline in the Frankfurter Volksblatt says: "600 Bastards Accuse, the legacy of black crime against the Rhinelanders"\nWhile anti-Semitism occupied a pre-eminent place at the heart of Nazi ideology, a line in Mein Kampf, the book published in 1925 outlining the political beliefs of party leader Adolf Hitler, linked Jewish and black people. "It was and is the Jews who bring the Negroes into the Rhineland," Hitler wrote, "always with the same secret thought and clear aim of ruining the hated white race by the necessarily resulting bastardisation."Once in power, the Nazis\' obsession with Jews and racial purity gradually led to the Holocaust, the industrialised slaughter of six million Jewish people during World War Two, as well as the mass murder of Roma, people with disabilities and some Slavic people.Mr Aitken, who researches the lives of black Germans, says they were targeted too - albeit not in the same systematic way. He describes them as being assimilated into the Nazis\' "spiralling radicalisation of racial policy".He says evidence shows their policies toward "other \'racial aliens\' hint toward a goal of racial annihilationism". \'I felt only half-human\'In 1935, the Nuremberg laws, which among other things outlawed marriages between Jews and other Germans, were passed. These were then amended to include black people and Roma in the same category as Jews. But a fear of racial mixing persisted and in 1937 the mixed-race children from the Rhineland were targeted for forced sterilisation.\nImage copyright\nGetty Images\nImage caption\nIn 1942, Heinrich Himmler wanted a census of all the black people living in Germany\nHans Hauck was one of at least 385 people who underwent the operation. Mr Hauck, the son of an Algerian soldier and a white German, appeared in the 1997 documentary Hitler\'s Forgotten Victims.He spoke about how he was taken in secret to have a vasectomy. He was then given a sterilisation certificate, to allow him to carry on working, and he had to sign an agreement saying he would not marry or have sex with people "with German blood"."It was depressing and oppressive," he told the documentary makers, "I felt only half-human".Another victim, Thomas Holzhauser, said on the film: "Sometimes I\'m glad I couldn\'t have children. At least they were spared the shame I lived with."\nGetty ImagesThe children were inhabiting two places at the same time. They were both insiders and outsiders"Amma AsanteWriter and director of Where Hands TouchVery few others spoke about their experiences while they were alive, and "there have not been many attempts to uncover what eventually happened to the majority of them", Mr Aitken, who is one of the few historians working on the subject, told the BBC."It is worthwhile remembering that the Nazis also wilfully destroyed many of the documents pertaining to camps and to sterilisation, making it difficult to reconstruct the fates of groups and individuals," he said.Ms Asante, who has also written and directed Belle and A United Kingdom, says many of these people suffered an identity crisis. They had a German parent and saw themselves as German, but they were also isolated and never fully embraced."The children were inhabiting two places at the same time. They were both insiders and outsiders," the 49-year-old said.Though their experiences differed, all black Germans were subjected to persecution under Nazi rule. Germany\'s colonial era, especially the attempted genocide of the Herero and Nama people in Namibia, already led to a negative view of Africans.\nMore on Germany\'s colonial legacy:\nNamibia\'s reparations and Germany\'s first genocide\nGermany returns skulls of Namibian genocide victims\nA 40-year search for a skull in Germany\nAfter Hitler came to power, they were harassed, humiliated in public, excluded from types of work and education, and essentially rendered stateless.There was some resistance. For example, Hilarius Gilges, who was mixed race, was a Communist and anti-Nazi agitator. He was kidnapped and murdered in 1933.Once war broke out in 1939, their position became more precarious. People in mixed relationships could be targeted for sterilisation, imprisonment or murder.Trying to be invisibleThat was the fear of Theodor Wonja Michael, who was born in Berlin in 1925 - the son of a Cameroonian man and a German womanGrowing up he appeared in so-called "human zoos", or ethnographical exhibitions, he told German broadcaster DW in 2017.\nImage copyright\nUS Holocaust Memorial Museum\nImage caption\nThis is thought to show Jean Voste (R), born in Belgium Congo, the only black prisoner in Dachau concentration camp (Photo courtesy of Frank Manucci)\n"With vast skirts, drums, dancing and songs - the idea was that people on display were foreign, exotic and were showing spectators what their homeland was like," he said. "Basically it was just a big show."Once the Nazis came to power he knew that he had to stay as invisible as possible, especially when he became a teenager. "Of course, with a face like this I could never completely disappear, but I tried."I avoided all contact with white women. That would have been horrible. I would have been sterilised and I might also have been charged with racial defilement," he said on the DW film Afro-Germany.\nImage copyright\nSpirit Entertainment\nImage caption\nAmma Asante says her film will make it difficult to deny that black people suffered during the Nazi era\nIn 1942, Heinrich Himmler, who was one of the architects of the Holocaust, ordered a census of the black people living in Germany. This could indicate the beginnings of a plan of mass murder, though no such plan was ever put in place.Instead, there is evidence of at least two dozen black Germans ending up in concentration camps in Germany."People would simply disappear and you wouldn\'t know what happened to them," Elizabeth Morton, whose parents ran an African entertainment troupe, said in the documentary Hitler\'s Forgotten Victims.Through Where Hands Touch, Ms Asante is trying to shed new light on these stories.As a British-Ghanaian she feels that the role and presence of people from the African diaspora in European history is often missed out - and says her film will make it difficult to deny that black people suffered at the hands of the Nazis. "I think there\'s a lot of ignorance and currently there\'s a lot of dismissing of what these people went through."Where Hands Touch is currently on release in the UK and on various streaming services in the US.\nRelated TopicsThe HolocaustGermanyBlack interest\nShare this story\nAbout\xa0sharing\nEmail\nFacebook\nMessenger\nMessenger\nTwitter\nPinterest\nWhatsApp\nLinkedIn\nMore on this story\nThe search in Germany for the lost skull of Tanzania\'s Mangi Meli\n13 November 2018\nGermany returns skulls of Namibian genocide victims\n29 August 2018\nVideo\nNamibia\'s reparations and Germany\'s first genocide\n12 October 2017\nAround the BBC\nAfrica Today podcasts\nRelated Internet links\nWhere Hands Touch\nUnited States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external Internet sites\nTop Stories\nJavid knocked out of Tory leadership contest\nBoris Johnson leads the race to be next Tory leader while Michael Gove overtakes Jeremy Hunt to move into second place.\n20 June 2019\nTory leadership race final ballot\n19 June 2019\nAbuse claims \'horrendous\' says former MP\n20 June 2019\nFeatures\nHow my sleepy hometown became a violent crime hotspot\nWhere giving vaccines can get you killed\nVideo\nChina\'s vanishing beards and mosques\nThe cafe where customers don\'t have to pay\nThe fake minister in a silicone mask who stole millions\nBrexit: Where do Conservative leadership candidates stand?\nVideo\nHow a four-day week has changed our lives\nWhy it\'s so hard to stop a cult\nVideo\nFighting vaccine fears in the UK\nElsewhere on the BBC\nEqual Playing Field\nBreaking world records to get women into football\nFull article Equal Playing Field\nDaily news briefing direct to your inbox\nSign up for our newsletter\nFull article Daily news briefing direct to your inbox\nWhy you can trust BBC News\nBBC News Navigation\nWorld\nSections\nAfrica\nselected\nAsia\nAustralia\nEurope\nLatin America\nMiddle East\nUS & Canada\nHome\nUK\nUK Home\nEngland\nN.

However, when the cars were allowed to communicate, they slowed down to let each other pass and keep traffic moving.The study concluded that driverless cars could improve traffic flow by at least 35%.Scientists are moving on to test the fleet in more complex scenarios, with different intersections, vehicle types and extra lanes.\n21 May 2019\nShare this with Facebook\nShare this with Messenger\nShare this with Twitter\nShare this with Email\nShare this with Facebook\nShare this with WhatsApp\nShare this with Messenger\nShare this with Twitter\nShare\nShare this with\nThese are external links and will open in a new window\nEmail\nShare this with Email\nFacebook\nShare this with Facebook\nMessenger\nShare this with Messenger\nMessenger\nShare this with Messenger\nTwitter\nShare this with Twitter\nPinterest\nShare this with Pinterest\nWhatsApp\nShare this with WhatsApp\nLinkedIn\nShare this with LinkedIn\nCopy this link\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-england-cambridgeshire-48359322/driverless-cars-cambridge-university-model-cars-talk-to-avoid-jams\nRead more about sharing.\nThese are external links and will open in a new window\nClose share panel\nGo to next video: Driverless cars tested in virtual simulator\nMore On:\nLoading...\nVideo Top Stories\nMust See\nMost watched\nWhy you can trust BBC News\nBBC News Navigation\nEngland\nSections\nEngland\nLocal News\nRegions\nCambridgeshire\nselected\nHome\nUK\nselected\nUK Home\nEngland selected\nN.

  'Select Bose smart speakers get Google Assistant – TechCrunch\nSelect Bose smart speakers get Google Assistant\nBrian Heater\n@bheater\n/\n1 month\nA week after Sonos added long-promised Google Assistant integration to a pair of speakers, Bose is following suit. The company’s bringing the popular smart home AI to a trio of existing models, the Home Speaker 500 and Soundbar 500 and 700. The forthcoming, pint-sized Home Speaker 300 will be hitting the market with the feature built-in.\nLike Sonos, you’ll get your standard array of Assistant queries, including music playback, Chromecast TV control and the ability to control connected home features like smart lighting. All of that will be accessible through the built-in speaker array. Like Sonos, the aforementioned speakers are also compatible with Alexa.\nIt’s clearly in the best interest of these third-party manufacturers not to have to play sides. For Google\nand Amazon, it means bringing their respective smart home ecosystems to a pair of well-regarded brands. Also like Sonos, setup happens in the company’s music app, which means, unfortunately, that you won’t have the full suite of setup options you get with Google’s own Home speakers.\nThe upgrade is available starting today. Additional features, including news and podcasts, are coming this summer. Ditto for the Home Speaker 300, which is arriving this summer.',
  'Facebook releases a trio of maps to aid with fighting disease outbreaks – TechCrunch\nFacebook releases a trio of maps to aid with fighting disease outbreaks\nSarah Perez\n@sarahintampa\n/\n1 month\nFacebook\nthis morning announced a new initiative focused on using its data and technologies to help nonprofit organizations and universities working in public health better map the spread of infectious diseases around the world. Specifically, the company is introducing three new maps: population density maps with demographic estimates, movement maps and network coverage maps. These, says Facebook, will help the health partners to understand where people live, how they’re moving and if they have connectivity — all factors that can aid in determining how to respond to outbreaks, and where supplies should be delivered.\nAs Facebook explained, health organizations rely on information like this when planning public health campaigns. But much of the information they rely on is outdated, like older census data. In addition, information from more remote communities can be scarce.\nBy combining the new maps with other public health data, Facebook believes organizations will be better equipped to address epidemics.\nThe new high-resolution population density maps will estimate the number of people living within 30-meter grid tiles, and provide insights on demographics, including the number of children under five, the number of women of reproductive age, as well as young and elderly populations. These maps aren’t built using Facebook data, but are instead built by using Facebook’s AI capabilities with satellite imagery and census information.\nMovement maps, meanwhile, track aggregate data about Facebook users’ movements via their mobile phones (when location services are enabled). At scale, health partners can combine this with other data to predict where other outbreaks may occur next.\nAbove: movement maps of London and surrounding areas\nAnd network coverage maps help to show where people can be reached with online messages — like those alerting to vaccination days or other health-related communications.\nOf course, it’s hard to not overlook the irony involved of Facebook data and tech being used to help with outbreaks that, in some cases, Facebook had a hand in creating. The company for years allowed the spread of vaccine misinformation to spread across its network. Irresponsibly, it also allowed Facebook Pages and Groups that promoted vaccine skepticism or outright false claims to rank at the top of Facebook searches for related terms, like “vaccines.”\nAfter time passed, it’s not surprising to find this spread of misinformation on Facebook and elsewhere resulted in measles outbreaks in the U.S. and abroad — a disease that had been eliminated as a major U.S. public health threat around 20 years ago. And despite repeated debunkings of false claims about the link between measles and autism by scientists, Facebook users — now feeling equipped by the internet to be experts on anything they can type into a search box — continued to spread misinformation at scale.\nOnce looped into the anti-vax communities, Facebook’s algorithms only further ensconced the skeptics into a world where only their opinions were correct, and they were surrounded by others who felt the same. This deepened their beliefs.\nToday, the World Health Organization says vaccine hesitancy is now one of the biggest threats in global public health, citing the 30% increase in measles cases worldwide.\nAbove: network coverage map in Democratic Republic of Congo following the recent Ebola outbreak\nFacebook only recently announced a plan to curb the spread of vaccine misinformation on its platforms, following government inquiries. But the health crisis it helped create by way of inattention is already well underway.\nTo be fair, Facebook is not the only platform corrupted by anti-vax misinformation — Pinterest, Twitter, YouTube and Facebook-owned Instagram have also just taken measures to address the problem. But Facebook is the largest social network, and a highly influential platform.\nOf course, vaccine-preventable diseases are only one of many crises (and potential crises) in public health, along with threats such as Ebola, antimicrobial resistance, influenza, dengue, HIV and many others. Access to more data can help health organizations in many areas.\nThis is not the first time Facebook has tapped its large data stores or other technologies to aid nonprofits and other researchers. The company has also provided aid organizations with anonymized location data for users in areas affected by disasters — including where people were marking themselves as safe, and where they were fleeing. In another humanitarian-related effort, Facebook has been working with AI to create population density maps, including most recently one showing the population of Africa.\n“Epidemics pose a growing threat to lives and livelihoods,” said Vanessa Candeias, head of Shaping the Future of Health and Healthcare at the World Economic Forum, in a Facebook announcement about the new maps. “Mitigating their risk and impact requires every tool in the toolbox.”',
  'TikTok owner ByteDance’s long-awaited chat app is here – TechCrunch\nTikTok owner ByteDance’s long-awaited chat app is here\nRita Liao\n1 month\nIn WeChat -dominated China, there’s no shortage of challengers out there claiming to create an alternative social experience. The latest creation comes from ByteDance, the world’s most valuable startup and the operator behind TikTok, the video app that has consistently topped the iOS App Store over the last few quarters.\nThe new offer is called Feiliao (飞聊), or Flipchat in English, a hybrid of an instant messenger plus interest-based forums, and it’s currently available for both iOS and Android. It arrived only four months after Bytedance unveiled its video-focused chatting app Duoshan at a buzzy press event.\nScreenshots of Feiliao / Image source: Feiliao\nSome are already calling Feiliao a WeChat challenger, but a closer look shows it’s targeting a more niche need. WeChat, in its own right, is the go-to place for daily communication in addition to facilitating payments, car-hailing, food delivery and other forms of convenience.\nFeiliao, which literally translates to ‘fly chat’, encourages users to create forums and chat groups centered around their penchants and hobbies. As its app description writes:\nFeiliao is an interest-based social app. Here you will find the familiar [features of] chats and video calls. In addition, you will discover new friends and share what’s fun; as well as share your daily life on your feed and interact with close friends.\nFeiliao “is an open social product,” said ByteDance\nin a statement provided to TechCrunch. “We hope Feiliao will connect people of the same interests, making people’s life more diverse and interesting.”\nIt’s unclear what Feiliao means by claiming to be ‘open’, but one door is already shut. As expected, there’s no direct way to transfer people’s WeChat profiles and friend connections to Feiliao, and there’s no option to log in via the Tencent app. As of Monday morning, links to Feiliao can’t be opened on WeChat, which recently crossed 1.1 billion monthly active users.\nOn the other side, Alibaba, Tencent’s long-time nemesis, is enabling Feiliao’s payments function through the Alipay\ndigital wallet. Alibaba has also partnered with Bytedance elsewhere, most notably on TikTok’s\nChinese version Douyin where certain users can sell goods via Taobao stores.\nIn all, Flipchat is more reminiscent of another blossoming social app — Tencent-backed Jike — than WeChat. Jike (pronounced ‘gee-keh’) lets people discover content and connect with each other based on various topics, making it one of the closest counterparts to Reddit in China.\nJike’s CEO Wa Nen has taken noticed of Feiliao, commenting with the 👌 emoji on his Jike feed, saying no more.\nScreenshot of Jike CEO Wa Nen commenting on Feiliao\n“I think [Feiliao] is a product anchored in ‘communities’, such as groups for hobbies, key opinion leaders/celebrities, people from the same city, and alumni,” a product manager for a Chinese enterprise software startup told TechCrunch after trying out the app.\nThough Feiliao isn’t a direct take on WeChat, there’s little doubt that the fight between Bytedance and Tencent has heated up tremendously as the former’s army of apps captures more user attention.\nAccording to a new report published by research firm Questmobile, ByteDance accounted for 11.3 percent of Chinese users’ total time spent on ‘giant apps’ — those that surpassed 100 million MAUs — in March, compared to 8.2 percent a year earlier. The percentage controlled by Tencent was 43.8 percent in March, down from 47.5 percent, while the remaining share, divided between Alibaba, Baidu and others, grew only slightly from 44.3 percent to 44.9 percent over the past year.\nTikTok is giving China a video chat alternative to WeChat\n(Corrects name in caption on May 20 to say “Wa Nen”, not “Wa Ren”.)',

Twenty years on, there is still tension over how Nato bombed Serbia for 11 weeks in an effort to push Serbian forces out of Kosovo, accusing them of atrocities against ethnic Albanians."When they sounded the alarm and the planes started to buzz, you never knew where the bombs would hit," says Djordjo Milenic, an elderly man who was friends with Djokovic\'s grandfather and lives in the adjacent block."They bombed whatever they wanted. \'Collateral damage,\' they said. They bombed bridges, hospitals, pregnant women died."His voice trails off. "It\'s hard, it\'s hard." We are in Banjica, a residential area about 7km south of downtown Belgrade. Locals describe it as "an average suburb", populated by working-class families from a Serbian ethnic background who live in moderately cheap high-rise flats. Djokovic\'s grandfather Vlada, as he was known by those close to him, lived in a two-bedroom flat here until his death in 2012.Now it is unoccupied, owned - according to neighbours, at least - by one of Djokovic\'s aunts, who they think lives in Switzerland.Nevertheless, it will always be intrinsically linked to the story of how Djokovic rose from humble beginnings to become one of the greatest tennis players that has ever lived.\nKey: 1-5 Bombings which killed civilians. 6 Djokovic\'s grandfather\'s flat. 7 Partizan Tennis ClubDjokovic was here with his widowed grandfather because his parents, father Srdjan and mother Dijana, spent most of their time away from Belgrade as they toiled to provide for their three sons - eldest Novak and his two younger brothers Marko and Djordje.That meant spending most of the year in Kopaonik, a mountain resort near Kosovo, more than four hours\' drive from Belgrade.By day they gave skiing lessons, by night they served pizza in the restaurant they owned. Srdjan and Dijana worked tirelessly to make ends meet while funding Novak\'s burgeoning tennis career.Not wishing to disrupt their children\'s education, the Djokovic boys stayed with granddad Vlada."The basement is practically where we stayed. Everyone who could fit here they came, there was no limitation," Novak said in an American TV documentary made by CBS in 2011."We were waking up every single night at 2am or 3am for two and a half months because of the bombings," he said of those 78 days in 1999."In a way these experiences made me a champion, it made us tougher, made us more hungry for success."Many people around Banjica know the Djokovic family. Some shared the basement where they sheltered.Milica Milivojevic is a 31-year-old woman who lives upstairs in Djokovic\'s old block.She says there were about "20 or 30" people inside the shelter, remembering it smelt of "moisture and humidity"."We heard bombs, but not while we were in the shelter," she says."From outside we could hear bombs falling on Avala (a hill on the edge of Belgrade targeted because there was a telecommunications tower)."Friends gathered in the basement, especially younger people. We played some board games - Monopoly or Risk - some older kids were drinking or doing drugs."She starts laughing: "A lot was going on."Of course there is no suggestion Djokovic, a child prodigy who had already appeared on national television proclaiming his dream was to win Wimbledon, took part in the \'edgier\' adolescent activities.He was too busy pursuing his dream of becoming world number one.Two murals celebrating Djokovic\'s achievements have been painted on tower blocks in Banjica. \'With belief in God\' is the slogan accompanying this one.Bogdan Obradovic has seen a lot in a life which has been dominated by tennis and politics.A promising junior player who moved into coaching aged 18, Obradovic was approached by Djokovic\'s father Srdjan to guide his 10-year-old boy.Later, Obradovic went on to become Serbia\'s Davis Cup captain - leading them to one of the nation\'s greatest sporting triumphs when the team containing Djokovic won the trophy in 2010. Now 52, he serves as a member of Serbia\'s parliament."Novak\'s father and I had some mutual friends and they told him I was a good coach and could maybe help him," he says."We did one practice and I was completely shocked. "He was completely prepared. He was warming up, he had a bottle of water, a banana, a towel, everything. I had never seen that from a kid so young."Obradovic knew he was a player - at that time "weighing around 25kg" - destined for the top.During the bombings he says they worked together "every day", going around Belgrade in search of courts they didn\'t have to pay to use."By that time people knew Novak and he was already popular so they helped him a lot. We trained at many different clubs," he says. "It was improvisation but that\'s how we did it."You know Only Fools and Horses? We love it here. And that is actually our mentality. We do everything through fun. And we always think, like Del Boy, our luck will change."We were in a terrible situation during the bombings. You hear the sound and see on the news, people were killed and everything is destroyed. But you can do nothing, and we found a way how to make fun. "I was with Novak all the time, we practised together and every day was like normal. He was focused but having so much fun at that time. He laughed so much."Djokovic often trained at the Partizan Tennis Club, an arm of the multi-sport body which also includes the 27-time national champion football team, plus successful basketball, water polo and volleyball sides.Dusan Grujic has been the Partizan president for 22 years and says this is the club Djokovic "has in his heart"."When you spend 11 years somewhere, like he did here, I don\'t know how we could say anything different," he adds."Novak made his first steps at Kopaonik, but that was only for a short time. When he was six, he came to Partizan. We provided him with everything we could and everything he wanted."Photos of their greatest son, along with other alumni including 2008 French Open champion Ana Ivanovic, line the walls of a modest clubhouse.One shows a boyish Novak wearing a Partizan baseball cap and scarf, alongside childhood friend Ivanovic. Djokovic\'s neighbour Djordjo Milenic says he used to tell grandfather Vlada that Novak "should marry her".Another shows Djokovic at 16, wearing the club\'s black and white stripes as he concentrates intently on gearing up a double-handed backhand, a shot he has since honed into one of his most potent.The clubhouse is being given its annual lick of paint on the day we arrive. Chairs and tables are stacked in the middle of the room while dust sheets cover the windows.Dragan Gavrilovic - one of the members responsible for maintaining the 75-year-old club - is more than happy to down tools and talk tennis. Pulling out a cigarette with white emulsion flicked over his fingers, he says: "When Novak was still small, from about 12 to 15, he used to come to play here and people from all over the city came to watch. "They knew - and we knew - he was destined for big things. Everybody wanted to see him. They wanted to see history being born."Back in Banjica, behind his old apartment block, a colourful mural shows Djokovic flanked on one side by the patriarchal grandfather he doted on, childhood coach Jelena Gencic on the other.Locals wander past without blinking an eye. Some may not even realise Djokovic lived there, but not many.A woman sweeping up leaves and dirt outside the one flat which has a garden stops to speak with us. "Yes, you should write about Novak, you should," she says."He\'s like from heaven. He\'s not human, yet he is a modest, normal guy."She has lived here for 40 years. She points to the concrete football pitch behind us, where a few stray dogs are sleeping in the sun."That\'s where he used to play football. When he had time, of course, because he trained so much."Then he became famous, but he would still come here as often as he could, if it was for one day or five minutes."The woman is reluctant to give her name and disappears back into her yard saying she doesn\'t want to talk any more.But she returns a few minutes later, clearly unable to stop herself sharing the pride and love she has for Djokovic. She was one of the many who spent nights down in the basement bomb shelter. Once that subject comes up, she retreats again. "Let\'s not talk about that," she says. "It\'s not nice to talk about what your neighbours did in such a delicate time."Yet she adds: "When we were there I told the younger ones to run, to leave the country. At that time we thought they will not bomb the civilians. But they did."\nNato - the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, the world\'s most powerful regional defence alliance - began its air strikes against Serbia on 24 March 1999. Accused of ethnic cleansing in Kosovo, Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic\'s regime was targeted in an attempt to force their troops out and allow international peacekeepers in, after diplomatic efforts failed. The bombing campaign ended on 10 June 1999, when Yugoslav troops began to withdraw from Kosovo.Nato said intervention was necessary to "halt the humanitarian catastrophe that was unfolding". But a number of attacks were "unlawful", according to Human Rights Watch - an independent organisation which investigates rights abuses across the world. Wounds still run deep in Serbia, and resentment towards Nato - and the countries which make it up - is prevalent on the streets of Belgrade."We are trying to be \'part of Europe\'. How come, when we are now part of Europe? How will they accept us, when we are European right now?" Djordjo Milenic, Djokovic\'s old neighbour, says."They bombed us and now they say we are friends. That\'s all organised by America and Britain."\nBombs hit the Yugoslav Ministry of Defence building in central Belgrade twice in the space of 15 minutes in the early hours of 30 April, 1999. It has still not been rebuilt.Kosovo especially remains a major topic. A political message outside the Partizan Tennis Club - one of many such slogans daubed around Belgrade - reads: \'Kosovo is a holy Serbian land.\' Many feel the \'Western\' media are obsessed with portraying a negative stereotype of the country as aggressive, unfriendly or hostile. That is another recurring topic of conversation in the city. And yet many others would rather move on. "People think we are bad people," says George Mitic, a 37-year-old taxi driver."But they don\'t come and see for themselves. If you only watch the news you have a completely different view."He tells a story from the previous night."I picked up some Scandinavians from the airport, they had come for business. They said they were scared."I said, \'why are you scared?\' They replied, \'because you\'ve had war here\'.""I told them we are open and friendly people."Nato launched an air campaign in Serbia - named Operation Allied Force - on 24 March, 1999. It lasted for 78 nights.Sasa Ozmo, a journalist for Sport Klub, describes Djokovic as a "national hero" who deeply understands the responsibility he has of promoting the nation\'s image across the world."But not only is he an ambassador outwards to the world, but he is also an ambassador within," he says."For example, there is a huge rivalry with Croatia - obviously there was the war and things stay fresh - but Novak is always very public about his support for the Croatian national football team. "That doesn\'t sit well with a lot of people here, but he is trying to change perspective. He\'s really good at that responsibility."Recently Djokovic finished top of a national newspaper poll which asked young people in Serbia who they looked up to the most."He is a huge role model. We\'ve had some really huge athletes who have inspired generations but they haven\'t inspired people in the same way Novak has done," Ozmo adds."For example, we have a basketball player called Vlade Divac who is also a huge global ambassador and played in the NBA during the bombings. "But Novak\'s range is much wider - he is a \'catch all\' hero in Serbia. The way his personality is he can identify with people."Tennis is the country\'s third sport behind football and basketball - but Novak is the most popular."\nWhat is Nato?Serbia country profileNato and Serbia put bombing behind them\nView Comments\nShare\nthis page\nShare this with\nDigg\nFacebook\nGoogle\nLinkedIn\nReddit\nStumbleUpon\nTwitter\nCopy this link http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/tennis/47284539 Read more about sharing.\nTop Stories\nAustralia turn screw on Bangladesh - clips, radio & text\nLive\nFrom the section Cricket\nRead more on Australia turn screw on Bangladesh - clips, radio & text\nWatch: Fifa Women\'s World Cup - Netherlands 0-0 Canada - Dutch top group as it stands\nLive\nFrom the section Football\nRead more on Watch: Fifa Women\'s World Cup - Netherlands 0-0 Canada - Dutch top group as it stands\nWatch: Fifa Women\'s World Cup - Cameroon 0-0 New Zealand - both need win to avoid exit\nLive\nFrom the section Football\nRead more on Watch: Fifa Women\'s World Cup - Cameroon 0-0 New Zealand - both need win to avoid exit\nMore from Sport Insight\n\'I cried every day\' - the cyclist who turns pain into triumph\nWhy did Messi walk away from Argentina?\nSacrifice, success & the shootings: Jamaica\'s tenacious World Cup star\nWill the World Cup be a cultural turning point for France?\nHow the Dutch came back from \'crisis\'\nThe \'skinny schoolkid\' among the super-humans: Robertson’s rise\nThe man who lost a brother, father & uncle to biking, but races on\n\'Pure luck\', guts & pandemonium: How Man Utd won 1999 Treble\nFrom war to Wimbledon: How Belgrade bombings shaped Djokovic\nThe woman who ‘had to fight and claw\' her way into motorsport\nThe disputed \'smuggler\'s haven\' ruled by Moldova\'s \'football kings\'\nThe third-tier football club labelled \'terrorists\' in Turkey\nSon Heung-min: Moulded by his father, mobbed in South Korea\n\'Maradona Land\' - How \'Argentina\'s Ajax\' unearthed a legend\nHow Ajax build success and prepare for break-up\nThe mind threatening sport’s ‘impossible’ bar\nIs the NFL Combine sport\'s weirdest test?\nIstanbul: Colour, passion and the new power backed by a president\nSolskjaer\'s early years & the Norwegian town that shaped him\nLove, loyalty & sacrifice in Seville: Joaquin\'s Betis story\n\'I left my youth behind and became a man\'\nInside Croatia’s fiery \'Eternal derby\'\nThe NFL star abandoned on London\'s streets\nJuan Mata: \'There\'s a risk football\'s essence will be lost\'\nLouis van Gaal: Legacy, retirement and \'his truth\' about Man Utd\nWhat is a manager\'s interview really like?\nDetermination, desire & defence: Declan Rice\'s rise\nAssurances and challenges for Zidane - Balague column\nThe fallout when East & West Germany met\n\'People died getting us to a cricket match.

Prime Minister Modi and his BJP party, like US President Donald Trump, have focused on borders to shape a particular vision of India\'s future.Shanti Chandri has lived in the small, impoverished village of Dimilapar, outside Assam\'s capital city of Guwahati, for half a century. The diminutive 79-year-old says she fears her 50 years as a resident will be erased after the state publishes its updated National Registry of Citizens (NRC), a census created in 1951 to determine who was born in India and who might be a migrant from the neighbouring, Muslim-majority East Pakistan, now known as Bangladesh. The census, conducted only in the north-eastern state of Assam, counts citizens who can prove they were residents of India before 24 March, 1971, a day before Bangladesh declared its independence from Pakistan. Families are required to provide documentation to show their lineage, and those who cannot prove their citizenship are deemed illegal. But the process has been fraught, with some families unable to produce documents due to poor record-keeping, illiteracy or because they lack the money to file a legal claim.\nShanti and her son Vinay, Hindus from the Bengali-speaking minority, were among those left off the NRC draft issued last year. Why Shanti\'s elder son, Paritush, was included on the list is unclear. Vinay, a 30-year-old day labourer, was overwhelmed by the 50,000 rupees ($715; £560) needed to fight his case in court. He was among many in the village who feared being placed in detention centres where hundreds of residents suspected of living in Assam illegally have been held. NRC officials have also begun holding "foreigner tribunals" to hear contested cases - much like the immigration court hearings under President Donald Trump at the US-Mexico border - while the draft list is being finalised to meet a 31 July deadline mandated by the Supreme Court.\nImage caption\nShanti Chandri, a Bengali Hindu, says her son took his life after the pair were left off the NRC draft last year\nIn total some four million people who thought they were Indian were excluded from the draft list. Half of these people have filed claims to be included in the final census.Vinay could not handle the stress of the uncertainty, Shanti says, and took his own life in May 2018. As she mourns her son, Shanti now worries about her own status if she is left off the finalised list. "Where shall I go and why should I flee?" she says. "It would be better that I too should die. Nobody is helping us. We are poor and weak people. The government should help us." The citizenship questionMr Modi\'s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has long railed against illegal immigration in India but has made the NRC a priority in recent years.Local officials say the list has nothing to do with religion, but activists see it as targeting the state\'s Bengali community, a large portion of whom are Muslims. Their fears are set against rhetoric from a Hindu nationalist government whose leader has not hidden his preference for Hindu migrants over Muslim ones.However significant numbers of Bengali-speaking Hindus have also been left off the citizenship list, underscoring the communal and ethnic tensions in the state. For local Assamese, the NRC is about deporting all illegal immigrants - not just one religious minority - in an effort to preserve their culture.The question of identity is one echoed 13,000km (8,000 miles) away in the US, where a similar resurgence of nationalism has emerged under Mr Trump, the Republican president whose inflammatory rhetoric has stoked anti-immigration fears along the US-Mexico border and divided Americans on national identity.\nA really simple guide to India’s general election\n900m voters, 39 days: 11 things about India polls\nNarendra Modi: The man who wants 900m votes\nHas PM Modi kept India safe?\n"While Trump is building his physical wall, Modi is creating a figurative one through policies like the NRC," says Milan Vaishnav, director of the South Asia programme at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.Though Mr Modi came to power two years before Mr Trump, the resurgence of his party\'s unbridled religious nationalism has come to define this year\'s election, and the struggle for India\'s identity as a pluralistic democracy.\n\'Infiltrators at the border\'BJP politicians have pointed to the NRC to amplify the threat of Muslim "infiltrators", while showing that they are curbing the tide of undocumented immigrants at India\'s borders. The party has suggested that such citizens registers could be drawn up across the country."These infiltrators are eating away at our country like termites," BJP President Amit Shah said during rallies on 11 April in West Bengal. "The NRC is our means of removing them."Mr Shah\'s anti-immigration rhetoric is similar to that of Mr Trump, who has been accused of fear-mongering, describing migrants from Central America as killers and criminals who threaten US security. The US president has made a crackdown on America\'s 11 million undocumented immigrants a rallying cry in his 2020 re-election campaign. He continues to push hardline immigration policy, toughening requirements for asylum seekers and, more recently, proposing a reduction to America\'s family-based admissions system. But while Mr Trump has indicated his plans to return undocumented immigrants to their countries, the future of people seen as illegal foreigners in India is less clear. Once the final list is published, residents whose appeals have been denied will be stripped of their citizenship, forcing their deportation or leaving them stateless. Vijay Kumar Gupta, a senior BJP leader in Assam, told the BBC the process was about separating migrants who fled religious persecution from those who sought economic relief, "damaging Assamese heritage". He suggested the government would evict those deemed illegal foreigners, but Bangladesh has rejected claims that any of its citizens reside in Assam illegally, calling the NRC a "local internal matter". Threatened by diversityMichael Kugelman, deputy director of the Asia Program at the Wilson Center, points out Mr Modi\'s emphasis on nationalism in this election fits with the broader global trend of rightwing populist leaders using polarising rhetoric across Asia, Europe, the US and South America. While nationalism is not a new sentiment in India, he notes, what\'s happening under Mr Modi has striking similarities to the political landscape in Mr Trump\'s America. Mr Kugelman says the parallels extend to the cult personalities of the two men, both considered "straight shooters" who push conservative politics, have deep business interests and are perceived as hostile toward their country\'s media - while also embracing social media.\nImage copyright\nGetty Images\nImage caption\nThe two leaders tout a fervent base of supporters and have had a difficult relationship with their country\'s media\n"There has always been these tensions festering underneath this veneer of India as a secular, pluralistic state, between those that think it\'s true and should continue to be a secular state, and those that think India is above all a Hindu state, and that identity should be promoted as much as possible," Mr Kugelman says,Those in the latter camp have been emboldened under Mr Modi\'s leadership, he adds, much like the growing tenor of anti-immigrant sentiment under Mr Trump in the last two years.\nBoth leaders have used national identity as a crude political tactic on the campaign trail, catering to a constituency feeling threatened by diversity and minority interests. Are Muslims being targeted?Assam\'s Muslim population, about one in three residents, fear the NRC is being used as a device to deport them from India. "The BJP is trying to divide society, and if they continue to do it, it will destroy the Indian identity," says Azizur Rahman, president of All Assam\'s Minority Student Union, a group advocating on behalf of those left off the NRC. "If they win, the next five years will be very tough for Muslims, and will be for decades to come." During the drafting process, residents have been able to challenge the citizenship of names included on the NRC, and some critics say those complaints have largely been directed at Muslims. "What was a process to segregate foreigners has so clearly become an anti-Muslim exercise," says Aman Wadud, a human rights lawyer based in Assam.Mr Gupta of the BJP strongly denied the NRC was being used as a means to target Muslims, saying that Mr Modi\'s government worked on behalf of all Indians.\nImage caption\n"We\'re facing unnecessary harassment," says teacher Ahmed Hussain\nAhmed Hussain, a science teacher at a government school in the village of Adabari, fears his family is among those ensnared in citizenship complications because of his name. "These types of problems against Muslims increased in Assam after the BJP formed the government in 2016."The 55-year-old teacher comes from a family that has lived for nine generations in the Assamese district of Dhubri, which sits next to the border with Bangladesh, nestled between pond-soaked fields, lush with water hyacinth, and the Brahmaputra river with its countless channels. Ahmed claims his father was involved in preparing the original NRC while serving in the Dhubri District Commissioner office in 1951, yet his family\'s Indian roots have been thrown into doubt over a complaint against his 18-year-old niece Nazia\'s inclusion on the list.The science student has just completed her studies in Guwahati, some 260km (160 miles) away from her hometown, with plans to become a medical doctor. But instead of studying, Nazia spends her time fighting the case against her, which implicates her entire family. "I\'m afraid for my future, my ability to find a job if I\'m not declared an Indian citizen," she says. "If I apply for a government job, will they target me for my Muslim identity? Why only us?"\nImage caption\n"If my name is left out of the final list, then we will go for justice," says Nazia Hussen\nAmong those lodging complaints against citizens are members of\nthe All Assam Students Union (AASU), which has been a driving force behind the completion of the NRC and the anti-immigration movement since its inception. AASU general secretary Lurinjyoti Gogoi acknowledges his members are filing complaints against citizens they believe come from "suspected areas", but blames NRC officials for any errors on the list. "We want a foreigner-free NRC list. This is a one-time exercise," he declares, adding that if some Indian citizens are forced to endure legal difficulties, it is in the interest of the Assamese people.\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device\nMedia captionLiving in limbo: Assam\'s four million unwanted\nThe battle for India\'s soulLast year the BJP government introduced the Citizenship Amendment Bill (CAB), legislation aimed at granting citizenship to religious minorities fleeing persecution from neighbouring Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh. It pointedly excluded Muslims, who the BJP contends do not count as a minority group. The fact that the central government was keen to welcome Hindus, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains and Parsis with no ties to the country while Assam\'s Muslims continued to fight for their right to stay in India angered many in the state and sparked violent protests.Opponents of the legislation argued it violated India\'s constitution by establishing religion as a requirement for citizenship. The BJP eventually soft-pedalled on the legislation, but if the party returns to power it may renew its efforts to push the legislation through India\'s parliament.\nWhatever happens, Mr Kugelman says the damage is done, deepening divisions about national identity. "Given the toxicity in politics and the nasty things that have been said and done, the discriminatory rhetoric and policies that we\'ve had for the last two years in India and the United States, it\'s going to take a long time for both of these countries to recover." While millions in Assam await the finalised NRC in July, which will determine whether they are accepted as Indian, the rest of the country will decide on 23 May if they agree with the BJP\'s conception of what that means.Speaking at a rally in Mumbai in April, Mr Modi told the crowd: "This election is not just for choosing a government, it is an election to decide the direction of India."Read more on immigration in India and the USIndia\nWhat happens to India\'s four million \'stateless\' people?\nChoosing citizenship on India-Bangladesh border\nLiving in limbo: Assam\'s four million unwanted\nUS\nFive numbers that explain US border crisis\nHow emergency powers could be used to build Trump\'s wall\nInside the chaotic effort to reunite separated families\nThe missing - consequences of Trump\'s immigration crackdown\nRelated TopicsNarendra ModiIndiaDonald TrumpUnited StatesIndia elections 2019\nShare this story\nAbout\xa0sharing\nEmail\nFacebook\nMessenger\nMessenger\nTwitter\nPinterest\nWhatsApp\nLinkedIn\nTop Stories\nJavid knocked out of Tory leadership contest\nBoris Johnson leads the race to be next Tory leader while Michael Gove overtakes Jeremy Hunt to move into second place.\n20 June 2019\nTory leadership race final ballot\n19 June 2019\nAbuse claims \'horrendous\' says former MP\n20 June 2019\nFeatures\nHow my sleepy hometown became a violent crime hotspot\nWhere giving vaccines can get you killed\nVideo\nChina\'s vanishing beards and mosques\nThe cafe where customers don\'t have to pay\nThe fake minister in a silicone mask who stole millions\nBrexit: Where do Conservative leadership candidates stand?\nVideo\nHow a four-day week has changed our lives\nWhy it\'s so hard to stop a cult\nVideo\nFighting vaccine fears in the UK\nElsewhere on the BBC\nEqual Playing Field\nBreaking world records to get women into football\nFull article Equal Playing Field\nDaily news briefing direct to your inbox\nSign up for our newsletter\nFull article Daily news briefing direct to your inbox\nWhy you can trust BBC News\nBBC News Navigation\nAsia\nSections\nAsia\nChina\nIndia\nselected\nHome\nUK\nUK Home\nEngland\nN.

  'FlareAgent, a platform that automates real estate transactions, launches out of YC – TechCrunch\nFlareAgent, a platform that automates real estate transactions, launches out of YC\nJordan Crook\n@jordanrcrook\n/\n1 month\nThe real estate industry is experiencing a bit of a rejuvenation. After years resisting the influence of tech, the industry is now feeling the entrance of e-buyers, as well as a variety of software to streamline the process. One such tech company looking to infiltrate real estate is FlareAgent, which launches today out of Y Combinator.\nFlareAgent\nwas founded by Abhi CVK and Rashid Aziz. The duo, who just graduated out of NYU, first built FlareAgent when Rashid’s dad, a real estate agent, was asked by his boss (Mr. Brown) about finding software that might speed up the process of completing a transaction.\nAbhi and Rashid built something that ended up helping grow the real estate firm from 20 deals per month to more than 100 deals/month. How?\nFlareAgent lets all parties collaborate on a transaction from the comfort of their own home or office. From purchase offers to escrow documents to the closing agreement, FlareAgent allows brokers and clients to view and interact with various documents to speed up the time to close.\nThis used to be done manually by brokers, who’d have to fax or mail or hand-deliver documents to and from various parties in the transaction. If changes take place to the paperwork, this process may start over from scratch.\nWith FlareAgent, all the time spent changing and sharing documents manually can be done online.\nTo be clear, a transaction doesn’t actually go through FlareAgent. In other words, the money changing hands from buyer to seller doesn’t flow through the FlareAgent platform. But all the documents that need to be reviewed, amended and signed can be handled on FlareAgent.\nTo make money, the company charges a monthly subscription to brokers using the platform.\nThus far, FlareAgent says it has around 100 active agents on the platform and has processed more than 2,500 transactions (worth $550 million in property value) since its inception.',

  'Facebook still a great place to amplify pre-election junk news, EU study finds – TechCrunch\nFacebook still a great place to amplify pre-election junk news, EU study finds\nNatasha Lomas\n@riptari\n/\n1 month\nA study carried out by academics at Oxford University to investigate how junk news is being shared on social media in Europe ahead of regional elections this month has found individual stories shared on Facebook’s\nplatform can still hugely outperform the most important and professionally produced news stories, drawing as much as 4x the volume of Facebook shares, likes, and comments.\nThe study, conducted for the Oxford Internet Institute’s (OII) Computational Propaganda Project, is intended to respond to widespread concern about the spread of online political disinformation on EU elections which take place later this month, by examining pre-election chatter on Facebook and Twitter in English, French, German, Italian, Polish, Spanish, and Swedish.\nJunk news in this context refers to content produced by known sources of political misinformation — aka outlets that are systematically producing and spreading “ideologically extreme, misleading, and factually incorrect information” — with the researchers comparing interactions with junk stories from such outlets to news stories produced by the most popular professional news sources to get a snapshot of public engagement with sources of misinformation ahead of the EU vote.\nAs we reported last year, the Institute also launched a junk news aggregator ahead of the US midterms to help Internet users get a handle on manipulative politically-charged content that might be hitting their feeds.\nIn the EU the European Commission\nhas responded to rising concern about the impact of online disinformation on democratic processes by stepping up pressure on platforms and the adtech industry — issuing monthly progress reports since January after the introduction of a voluntary code of practice last year intended to encourage action to squeeze the spread of manipulative fakes. Albeit, so far these ‘progress’ reports have mostly boiled down to calls for less foot-dragging and more action.\nOne tangible result last month was Twitter introducing a report option for misleading tweets related to voting ahead of the EU vote, though again you have to wonder what took it so long given that online election interference is hardly a new revelation. (The OII study is also just the latest piece of research to bolster the age old maxim that falsehoods fly and the truth comes limping after.)\nThe study also examined how junk news spread on Twitter\nduring the pre-EU election period, with the researchers finding that less than 4% of sources circulating on Twitter’s platform were junk news (or “known Russian sources”) — with Twitter users sharing far more links to mainstream news outlets overall (34%) over the study period.\nAlthough the Polish language sphere was an exception — with junk news making up a fifth (21%) of EU election-related Twitter traffic in that outlying case.\nReturning to Facebook, while the researchers do note that many more users interact with mainstream content overall via its platform, noting that mainstream publishers have a higher following and so “wider access to drive activity around their content” and meaning their stories “tend to be seen, liked, and shared by far more users overall”, they also point out that junk news still packs a greater per story punch — likely owing to the use of tactics such as clickbait, emotive language, and outragemongering in headlines which continues to be shown to generate more clicks and engagement on social media.\nIt’s also of course much quicker and easier to make some shit up vs the slower pace of doing rigorous professional journalism — so junk news purveyors can get out ahead of news events also as an eyeball-grabbing strategy to further the spread of their cynical BS. (And indeed the researchers go on to say that most of the junk news sources being shared during the pre-election period “either sensationalized or spun political and social events covered by mainstream media sources to serve a political and ideological agenda”.)\n“While junk news sites were less prolific publishers than professional news producers, their stories tend to be much more engaging,” they write in a data memo covering the study. “Indeed, in five out of the seven languages (English, French, German, Spanish, and Swedish), individual stories from popular junk news outlets received on average between 1.2 to 4 times as many likes, comments, and shares than stories from professional media sources.\n“In the German sphere, for instance, interactions with mainstream stories averaged only 315 (the lowest across this sub-sample) while nearing 1,973 for equivalent junk news stories.”\nTo conduct the research the academics gathered more than 584,000 tweets related to the European parliamentary elections from more than 187,000 unique users between April 5 and April 20 using election-related hashtags — from which they extracted more than 137,000 tweets containing a URL link, which pointed to a total of 5,774 unique media sources.\nSources that were shared 5x or more across the collection period were manually classified by a team of nine multi-lingual coders based on what they describe as “a rigorous grounded typology developed and refined through the project’s previous studies of eight elections in several countries around the world”.\nEach media source was coded individually by two separate coders, via which technique they say was able to successfully label nearly 91% of all links shared during the study period.\nThe five most popular junk news sources were extracted from each language sphere looked at — with the researchers then measuring the volume of Facebook interactions with these outlets between April 5 and May 5, using the NewsWhip Analytics dashboard.\nThey also conducted a thematic analysis of the 20 most engaging junk news stories on Facebook during the data collection period to gain a better understanding of the different political narratives favoured by junk news outlets ahead of an election.\nOn the latter front they say the most engaging junk narratives over the study period “tend to revolve around populist themes such as anti-immigration and Islamophobic sentiment, with few expressing Euroscepticism or directly mentioning European leaders or parties”.\nWhich suggests that EU-level political disinformation is a more issue-focused animal (and/or less developed) — vs the kind of personal attacks that have been normalized in US politics (and were richly and infamously exploited by Kremlin-backed anti-Clinton political disinformation during the 2016 US presidential election, for example).\nThis is likely also because of a lower level of political awareness attached to individuals involved in EU institutions and politics, and the multi-national state nature of the pan-EU project — which inevitably bakes in far greater diversity. (We can posit that just as it aids robustness in biological life, diversity appears to bolster democratic resilience vs political nonsense.)\nThe researchers also say they\xa0identified two noticeable patterns in the thematic content of junk stories that sought to cynically spin political or social news events for political gain over the pre-election study period.\n“Out of the twenty stories we analysed, 9 featured explicit mentions of ‘Muslims’ and the Islamic faith in general, while seven mentioned ‘migrants’, ‘immigration’, or ‘refugees’… In seven instances, mentions of Muslims and immigrants were coupled with reporting on terrorism or violent crime, including sexual assault and honour killings,” they write.\n“Several stories also mentioned the Notre Dame fire, some propagating the idea that the arson had been deliberately plotted by Islamist terrorists, for example, or suggesting that the French government’s reconstruction plans for the cathedral would include a minaret. In contrast, only 4 stories featured Euroscepticism or direct mention of European Union\nleaders and parties.\n“The ones that did either turned a specific political figure into one of derision – such as Arnoud van Doorn, former member of PVV, the Dutch nationalist and far-right party of Geert Wilders, who converted to Islam in 2012 – or revolved around domestic politics. One such story relayed allegations that Emmanuel Macron\nhad been using public taxes to finance ISIS jihadists in Syrian camps, while another highlighted an offer by Vladimir Putin to provide financial assistance to rebuild Notre Dame.”\nTaken together, the researchers conclude that\xa0“individuals discussing politics on social media ahead of the European parliamentary elections shared links to high-quality news content, including high volumes of content produced by independent citizen, civic groups and civil society organizations, compared to other elections we monitored in France, Sweden, and Germany”.\nWhich suggests that attempts to manipulate the pan-EU election are either less prolific or, well, less successful than those which have targeted some recent national elections in EU Member States. And logic would suggest that co-ordinating election interference across a 28-Member State bloc does require greater co-ordination and resource vs trying to meddle in a single national election — on account of the multiple countries, cultures, languages and issues involved.\nWe’ve reached out to Facebook for comment on the study’s findings.\xa0Update:\xa0A company spokesperson has now sent the following statement:\nWe’ve been working hard to stop the spread of false news. Actors seeking to profit from misinformation are highly motivated and continue to employ new tactics to garner clicks, so it’s possible to pick out specific examples of things we miss and there will occasionally be false news posts that perform well–but what we’re really interested in is the\xa0overall\xa0amount of misinformation on Facebook, and whether that’s trending down. By Oxford’s own admission, overall, mainstream media coverage of the EU elections performed better than “junk news” on Facebook, both in terms of publisher following and engagement.\nThe company has put a heavy focus on publicizing its self-styled ‘election security’ efforts ahead of the EU election. Though it has mostly focused on setting up systems to control political ads — whereas junk news purveyors are simply uploading regular Facebook ‘content’ at the same time as wrapping it in bogus claims of ‘journalism’ — none of which Facebook objects to. All of which allows would-be election manipulators to pass off junk views as online news, leveraging the reach of Facebook’s platform and its attention-hogging algorithms to amplify hateful nonsense. While any increase in engagement is a win for Facebook’s ad business, so er…\nWhen it comes to elections, Facebook moves slow, may still break things',

  "Raisin rides into the US with its savings and investment marketplace – TechCrunch\nRaisin rides into the US with its savings and investment marketplace\nSteve O'Hear\n@sohear\n/\n1 month\nRaisin, the pan-European fintech marketplace for savings and investment products, is headed to the U.S., announcing plans to roll out a similar offering across the pond.\nThe German company, which is backed by the likes of PayPal, Index Ventures, Ribbit Capital and Thrive Capital, wants to bring greater competition and easier savings and deposit account opening to U.S. customers. The deposits market in the U.S. is said to be $12.7 trillion, and yet Raisin\nclaims most Americans could be getting a much better return on their savings.\nDespite the U.S. Federal Reserve raising interest rates and most consumers having ample opportunities to optimise their savings in theory, Raisin says shopping around for a competitive savings rate often involves too many hurdles for many American to bother. This includes finding out where good rates are available, assessing the quality of offers and, in some instances, switching from your existing primary bank.\nIn contrast, Raisin’s marketplace model claims to address these issues by making the range of offers transparent, whilst also creating a convenient and simple way to access the best rates on the market. Part of its remedy is that users only have to sign up to Raisin once, including regulatory checks, in order to access any of the offers from partner banks on its platform.\nTo kick off the new U.S. expansion, Raisin has hired Paul Knodel as U.S. CEO. Boasting 20 years financial industry experience, prior to joining Raisin he held executive and senior management positions at Citigroup and Merrill Lynch, as well as TD Ameritrade, E-Trade and robo-advisor Wealthfront. Most recently Knodel led Wealthfront’s extension of its product suite into cash savings.\nIn addition, Raisin’s American expansion is being supported by the German government’s U.S.-based “German Accelerator” program.

This could lead to the displacement of hundreds of millions of people, the authors say.\nAntarctic instability \'is spreading\'\nThousands of penguin chicks wiped out\nWarning from \'Antarctica\'s last forests\'\nThe question of sea-level rise was one of the most controversial issues raised by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), when it published its fifth assessment report in 2013.\nIt said the continued warming of the planet, without major reductions in emissions, would see global waters rising by between 52cm and 98cm by 2100.\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device\nMedia captionUN chief: Political will is fading even as the situation worsens, Antonio Guterres said\nMany experts believe this was a very conservative estimate.Ice scientists are also concerned that the models currently used to predict the influence of huge ice sheets on sea levels don\'t capture all of the uncertainties about how these are now melting. Judgement dayTo try to get a clearer picture, some of the leading researchers in the field carried out what is termed a structured expert judgement study, where the scientists make predictions based on their knowledge and understanding of what is happening in Greenland, West and East Antarctica.In the researchers\' view, if emissions continue on the current trajectory then the world\'s seas would be very likely to rise by between 62cm and 238cm by 2100. This would be in a world that had warmed by around 5C - one of the worst-case scenarios for global warming.\nImage copyright\nGetty Images\n"For 2100, the ice sheet contribution is very likely in the range of 7-178cm but once you add in glaciers and ice caps outside the ice sheets and thermal expansion of the seas, you tip well over two metres," said lead author Prof Jonathan Bamber from the University of Bristol.\nImage copyright\nJonathan Bamber\nImage caption\nA small boat in the Illulissat Icefjord in western Greenland, dwarfed by icebergs that have calved from Greenland\'s largest glacier, Jacobshavn Isbrae\nThe IPCC report in 2013 only considered what is "likely" to happen, which in scientific terms means they looked at 17-83% of the range of possibilities. This new study looks at a broader range of results, covering 5-95% of the estimates.\nFor expected temperature rises up to 2C, Greenland\'s ice sheet remains the single biggest contributor to sea-level rise. However, as temperatures go beyond this, the much larger Antarctic ice sheets start to come into play. "When you start to look at these lower likelihood but still plausible values, then the experts believe that there is a small but statistically significant probability that West Antarctica will transition to a very unstable state and parts of East Antarctica will start contributing as well," said Prof Bamber.\n"But it\'s only at these higher probabilities for 5C that we see those type of behaviours kicking in."According to the authors, this scenario would have huge implications for the planet. They calculate that the world would lose an area of land equal to 1.79 million square kilometres - equivalent to the size of Libya. Much of the land losses would be in important food growing areas such as the delta of the Nile.\nLarge swathes of Bangladesh would be very difficult for people to continue to live in. Major global cities, including London, New York and Shanghai would be under threat. "To put this into perspective, the Syrian refugee crisis resulted in about a million refugees coming into Europe," said Prof Bamber.\nImage copyright\nJonathan Bamber\nImage caption\nA German supply ship moored at the edge of an ice shelf in West Antarctica\n"That is about 200 times smaller than the number of people who would be displaced in a 2m sea-level rise." The authors emphasise that there is still time to avoid these type of scenarios, if major cuts in emissions take place over the coming decades. They acknowledge that the chances of hitting the high end of this range are small, around 5%, but they should not be discounted, according to the lead author. "If I said to you that there was a one in 20 chance that if you crossed the road you would be squashed you wouldn\'t go near it," said Prof Bamber. "Even a 1% probability means that a one in a hundred year flood is something that could happen in your lifetime.\nI think that a 5% probability, crikey - I think that\'s a serious risk."Other experts in the field said that the findings of the expert group were significant. "This kind of survey of experts is important, because computer models are not perfect at predicting the future," said Dr Tamsin Edwards from King\'s College London. "Here they took the eight most accurate of 22 experts on Antarctica and Greenland and combined their judgements about the future. The ice sheets are losing ice at increasing rates, and we can\'t rule out high values of sea level rise, though it\'s also important to note they\'re unlikely - especially as we are starting to put policies in place to avoid such a high level of warming." The study has been published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\nSign up for a chat about climate change on Facebook Messenger\nFollow Matt on Twitter.\nView comments\nRelated TopicsOceansAntarcticClimate change\nShare this story\nAbout\xa0sharing\nEmail\nFacebook\nMessenger\nMessenger\nTwitter\nPinterest\nWhatsApp\nLinkedIn\nTop Stories\nJavid knocked out of Tory leadership contest\nBoris Johnson leads the race to be next Tory leader while Michael Gove overtakes Jeremy Hunt to move into second place.\n20 June 2019\nTory leadership race final ballot\n19 June 2019\nAbuse claims \'horrendous\' says former MP\n20 June 2019\nFeatures\nHow my sleepy hometown became a violent crime hotspot\nWhere giving vaccines can get you killed\nVideo\nChina\'s vanishing beards and mosques\nThe cafe where customers don\'t have to pay\nThe fake minister in a silicone mask who stole millions\nBrexit: Where do Conservative leadership candidates stand?\nVideo\nHow a four-day week has changed our lives\nWhy it\'s so hard to stop a cult\nVideo\nFighting vaccine fears in the UK\nElsewhere on the BBC\nEqual Playing Field\nBreaking world records to get women into football\nFull article Equal Playing Field\nDaily news briefing direct to your inbox\nSign up for our newsletter\nFull article Daily news briefing direct to your inbox\nWhy you can trust BBC News\nBBC News Navigation\nSections\nHome\nUK\nUK Home\nEngland\nN.

"We should let fish grow and breed. Otherwise, we will have to suffer in the future."\nThe government says the coast guard and navy will enforce the ban in the Bay of Bengal.\nThe fish that is being loved to death\n\'Fish are vanishing\' - Senegal\'s devastated coastline\nThere have been short-term bans on commercial fishing in the past but this is the first time that all fishing boats, including local fishermen, have been banned for a lengthy period. The government says that fishing will now be banned between 20 May and 23 July every year.Fishing associations have called on the prime minister to re-consider the ban. They are also asking for compensation.Fish, such as hilsa, forms an important part of local diets and is also processed for export.Hilsa, a kind of herring, used to be abundant in the waters along the Bay of Bengal but stocks have declined in recent decades due to overfishing.

Who is this American philanthropist?During his speech on Sunday morning to the historically black Morehouse College in Atlanta, Mr Smith stunned the class of 2019 with his pledge to wipe out their debt, thought to be worth up to $40m (£31m).It was a rare foray into the limelight for a low profile tycoon who was virtually unknown on the national stage until a few years ago.Mr Smith, 56, is the founder of the private equity firm Vista Equity Partners and one of the nation\'s most prominent African-American philanthropists.\nInvestor to pay entire class\'s student debt\nThe story of historically black colleges in the US\n\'Student debt is unfair burden\'\nVista, which focuses on software companies, is now valued at over $46bn and is one of the best-performing firms in its class, according to Forbes.\nMr Smith\'s net worth is estimated to be around $5bn - making him the wealthiest black American, ahead of Oprah Winfrey.\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device\nMedia captionThe moment a billionaire cleared a whole class\'s student debt\nHe grew up in a primarily black neighbourhood in Denver, Colorado, the son of two school principals with doctorate degrees in education.When he was a high school student, Mr Smith applied for an internship at scientific development company Bell Labs, but was told he was too young. Demonstrating the kind of grit that would be the makings of his success, he reportedly proceeded to call the company every week for five months until he was accepted. Mr Smith went on to study chemical engineering at Cornell University in upstate New York and later received his MBA from Columbia University.Following his master\'s, Mr Smith took a job in San Francisco at Goldman Sachs, where he began working with technology companies Apple and Microsoft, among others.In 2000, he left Goldman Sachs to found Vista, and he remains the company\'s chief executive. He has spoken about dealing with racism in the cliquey industry of investment, telling the New York Times in 2014 he sometimes felt pressured to work twice as hard as his peers because of his race. As a result, Vista has prioritised diversity and merit-based hiring, using a personality test to find well-rounded candidates.\nImage copyright\nGetty Images\nImage caption\nMr Smith received an honorary doctorate from Morehouse College on Sunday\nMr Smith, who has long guarded his privacy, resides in Austin, Texas, with his wife, former Playboy model Hope Dworaczyk. Singers at their 2015 wedding on Italy\'s Amalfi Coast included John Legend and Seal.Even before Sunday\'s surprise gift, Mr Smith had worked with Morehouse, donating $1.5m towards scholarships and development at the institution. In 2017, Mr Smith became the first black American to commit to donating the majority of his wealth as a part of the Giving Pledge, a philanthropic commitment created by Bill and Melinda Gates and Warren Buffett.In his profile for the charity, Mr Smith wrote: "I will never forget that my path was paved by my parents, grandparents and generations of African-Americans whose names I will never know. "Their struggles, their courage, and their progress allowed me to strive and achieve. "My story would only be possible in America, and it is incumbent on all of us to pay this inheritance forward."Morehouse was not Mr Smith\'s first donation to higher education.In 2016, he donated $50m to his alma mater Cornell, creating a programme to support black and female engineering students. He is also a founding donor for the National Museum of African American History and Culture, giving $20m ahead of its opening in September of that year.Mr Smith has his own charitable initiative, the Fund II Foundation, which supports preserving African-American culture, promoting human rights, environmental conservation efforts, music education and entrepreneurship. An avid music lover, the 56-year-old is also the chairman of Carnegie Hall - one of the most high-profile concert halls in the US.\nHe has founded numerous youth music initiatives working with Carnegie Hall and other institutions, like The Juilliard School and New York City Department of Education.\nRelated TopicsGeorgiaUnited StatesStudent debt\nShare this story\nAbout\xa0sharing\nEmail\nFacebook\nMessenger\nMessenger\nTwitter\nPinterest\nWhatsApp\nLinkedIn\nMore on this story\nVideo\nUS billionaire clears 400 student loans\n20 May 2019\nThe story of historically black colleges in the US\n15 February 2019\nBillionaire Robert F Smith to pay entire US class\'s student debt\n19 May 2019\nTop Stories\nJavid knocked out of Tory leadership contest\nBoris Johnson leads the race to be next Tory leader while Michael Gove overtakes Jeremy Hunt to move into second place.\n20 June 2019\nTory leadership race final ballot\n19 June 2019\nAbuse claims \'horrendous\' says former MP\n20 June 2019\nFeatures\nHow my sleepy hometown became a violent crime hotspot\nWhere giving vaccines can get you killed\nVideo\nChina\'s vanishing beards and mosques\nThe cafe where customers don\'t have to pay\nThe fake minister in a silicone mask who stole millions\nBrexit: Where do Conservative leadership candidates stand?\nVideo\nHow a four-day week has changed our lives\nWhy it\'s so hard to stop a cult\nVideo\nFighting vaccine fears in the UK\nElsewhere on the BBC\nEqual Playing Field\nBreaking world records to get women into football\nFull article Equal Playing Field\nDaily news briefing direct to your inbox\nSign up for our newsletter\nFull article Daily news briefing direct to your inbox\nWhy you can trust BBC News\nBBC News Navigation\nUS & Canada\nHome\nUK\nUK Home\nEngland\nN.

  'Quadric.io raises $15M to build a plug-and-play supercomputer for autonomous systems – TechCrunch\nQuadric.io raises $15M to build a plug-and-play supercomputer for autonomous systems\nKirsten Korosec\n1 month\nQuadric.io, a startup founded by some of the folks behind the once-secretive bitcoin mining operation “21E6,”\xa0has raised $15 million in a Series A round that will fund the development of a supercomputer designed for autonomous systems.\nThe round was led by automotive Tier 1 supplier DENSO and its semiconductor products arm NSITEXE, which will also be one of Quadric.io’s customers for future electronic systems in all levels of autonomous driving solutions. Leawood VC also participated in the Series A round.\nThe company says it will use the injection of capital to build out its product and hire more people, as well as business development.\nPear,\xa0Uncork Capital,\xa0SV Angel,\xa0Cota Capital\xa0and\xa0Trucks VC are seed investors in Quadric.io.\nThe roots of Quadric.io grew from a seemingly disconnected mission to produce an agricultural robot designed to transform the way vineyards were managed. The company launched in 2016 by CEO Veerbhan Kheterpal, CTO Nigel Drego and CPO Daniel Firu —\xa0all co-founders of 21 Inc. The bitcoin startup, once known as 21E6, would later rebrand as Earn.com before being acquired by Coinbase for $100 million.\nQuadric’s original plan was stymied by some real-world fundamentals. The power-hungry ag robot was weighed down by batteries that became too unwieldy to move amongst vineyard rows and the processing time to turn loads of environmental data into actual actions based on algorithms were too slow.\nQuadric was looking for a chip designed for processing on the edge and that supported decision making in real time — all while crunching data faster and sipping, not slurping power. That need grew into Quadric’s core product today: a supercomputer that the company says hits that sweet spot of increased computational speed and reduced power consumption.\nKheterpal noted in a recent post on Medium that Intel’s CPUs work “very well for standard computer processing” and Nvidia’s GPUs have “ushered in astounding new graphics processing for gaming and much more.” But, he argued, Quadric needed something neither of those companies could provide: a chip designed for processing on the edge.\nThe company created a single unified architecture in the supercomputer that enables high-performance computing and artificial intelligence. The supercomputer, which is built around the Quadric Processor, is plug-and-play. This means people can plug in their sensor set and build their entire application to support “near-instantaneous” decision making, Quadric says. The company claims that early testing of Quadric’s system has shown up to 100 times lower latency and a 90% reduction in power consumption.\nQuadric designed the instruction set, chip architecture and system architecture of the chip. System-level manufacturing is done at a contract manufacturer in Santa Clara, Calif., while chip manufacturing and assembly is done in Asia.\nQuadric argues this underlying technology is a prerequisite for companies developing autonomous systems that will be used in the construction, transportation, agriculture and warehousing industries. The underlying tech that supports autonomous machines used in these industries either\xa0lacks the performance or solves only a small part of the full application, according to Quadric.\nThe startup contends that machines with autonomous functions require processing speed and responsiveness “on the edge” — meaning at the machine level, not in the cloud.\nOther companies, most recently Tesla, have opted to build their own chips to meet this specific need. But as\xa0Kheterpal notes, not all companies have the resources to build the tech from the ground up.\n“\u200aQuadric is a plug and play option that eliminates the need for building heterogeneous systems with significant hardware and software integration costs\u200a—\u200athereby taking years off of product development roadmaps,” Kheterpal wrote.',

"I\'m sorry he didn\'t get to play, but no one knows what will happen," Zidane said."If I think a player doesn\'t fit in the team, I have to do what I think works best. "No one can change what Bale has done for the team, but as a coach I have to live in the present."Asked about the future of Bale and goalkeeper Keylor Navas, who has also been linked with a move away, he added: "I don\'t know if it\'s the last game for them or not. I don\'t know what\'s going to happen."Calderon believes Bale\'s time at Madrid will come to an end this summer after six years following his record £85m switch from Tottenham, as his relationship with Zidane is so poor."It seems it was his last game for Real Madrid," said Calderon."Zidane, last year when he left, he thought it was imperative to keep [Cristiano] Ronaldo and to sell Bale and they decided not to do that."It seems it is impossible for him to be here... because of the coach and the relationship with the fans. They think he is not committed and that is a problem. "The best thing for him is to move. He should take the opportunity if there is one."Calderon says Madrid will be prepared to take a financial hit to get Bale away from the club.The 29-year-old has been linked with a return to Tottenham Hotspur, though Bale\'s wages far exceed those of Spurs\' top earner Harry Kane."Maybe he will go on loan. It is a problem when the coach and player do not get along, you have to look at every option to find a solution," Calderon added."The problem is the salary it is a high salary. He has not been lucky at Madrid since the beginning. Fans thought for the money he would be better than Cristiano and that was really impossible."It is a divorce that is difficult to solve. They will find a loan or a transfer for perhaps a low amount of money."\nShare\nthis page\nShare this with\nDigg\nFacebook\nGoogle\nLinkedIn\nReddit\nStumbleUpon\nTwitter\nCopy this link http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/48330478 Read more about sharing.\nFind out more\nBBC Wales News & Sport\nRead more on BBC Wales News & Sport\nBBC Sport Welsh Football\nRead more on BBC Sport Welsh Football\nFootball Association of Wales\nRead more on Football Association of Wales\nTop Stories\nAustralia turn screw on Bangladesh - clips, radio & text\nLive\nFrom the section Cricket\nRead more on Australia turn screw on Bangladesh - clips, radio & text\nWatch: Fifa Women\'s World Cup - Netherlands 0-0 Canada - Dutch top group as it stands\nLive\nFrom the section Football\nRead more on Watch: Fifa Women\'s World Cup - Netherlands 0-0 Canada - Dutch top group as it stands\nWatch: Fifa Women\'s World Cup - Cameroon 0-0 New Zealand - both need win to avoid exit\nLive\nFrom the section Football\nRead more on Watch: Fifa Women\'s World Cup - Cameroon 0-0 New Zealand - both need win to avoid exit\nGet Inspired\nFind ways to get active\nHow to get involved in just about any sport or activity\nFind a club, activity or sport near you\nBack to top\nWelsh Football\nScores & Fixtures\nTables\nWelsh Football Home\nMore from Football\nAll Scores & Fixtures\nAll Teams\nLeagues & Cups\nWales Home\nFootball Home\nNews Feeds\nHelp & FAQs\nExplore the BBCHomeNewsSportWeatheriPlayerSoundsCBBCCBeebiesFoodBitesizeArtsTasterLocalTVRadioThree Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCGet Personalised NewslettersCopyright © 2019 BBC.

What came back confirmed his worst fears. The children were infected with HIV - and no-one knows why."By 24 April, 15 children had tested positive, though none of their parents were found to be carrying the virus," the hospital doctor told the BBC.\nIt was only the tip of the iceberg.In the past month, more than 607 people - 75% of them children - have been diagnosed with the virus after rumours of an outbreak sent families rushing to a special camp set up at the town\'s government hospital by the health department of Sindh province.Perhaps more surprising, however, is the fact that this is not the first outbreak to hit the region in recent years.\nImage copyright\nAFP\nImage caption\nThousands of people are being tested around the country\nRumours of a possible outbreak in Sindh province\'s Larkana, of which Ratto Dero is a sub-division, prompted thousands of people to get tested back in 2016. On that occasion, 1,521 people were found to be HIV positive, according to figures available with Sindh Aids Control Programme (SACP).The vast majority of those infected were men and, at the time, the cause was linked to the area\'s sex workers, who were mainly transgender and 32 of whom were found to be carrying the Aids virus.The discovery of the outbreak led to a crackdown on Larkana\'s travellers\' inns, where sex workers had been able to ply their trade relatively freely, despite a ban on prostitution in Pakistan.But could that outbreak be linked to health officials\' recent discovery?\nRead more like this\nThe woman who helps 5,000 children orphaned by HIV/Aids\nThe secret in my blood\nThe HIV-positive man who stopped thousands getting the virus\nMy cheating boyfriend gave me HIV - here\'s how I got justice\nDr Asad Memon, who heads the SACP operations in Larkana, believes so - although not directly."I think the (Aids) virus was being carried by members of the high-risk group (transgender and female sex workers) and then lax practices by local quacks caused it to infect other patients," he told the BBC.By "quack" he is referring to under-qualified people practising medicine, ranging from paramedics running a private clinic posing as doctors, to medical graduates who have been unable to find work in hospitals and have no exposure to standard medical practices.\nImage copyright\nAFP\nImage caption\nMultiple use of single syringes is suspected to be a factor in the new outbreak, though investigations are ongoing\nIn Pakistan, especially in rural areas, people often go to "quacks" instead of qualified doctors because they are cheaper, easily available, and have more time to give to their patients.Dr Fatima Mir, who works for the Aga Khan University Hospital and specialises in Aids among children, is currently doing volunteer work in Ratto Dero. She agrees that negligent medical practices are the most likely link between the children and the 2016 outbreak."There are three ways a child may be infected," she explained. "It\'s either through a lactating mother who carries the virus, through blood transfusion, or through an infected surgical instrument or a syringe."In most cases she has handled, the mothers tested negative for HIV and few children had undergone blood transfusions. So the only remaining explanation was the practice of using one syringe for several patients at local clinics.Officials also appear to agree. About 500 unregulated clinics have been ordered closed across the province, the health authorities reported.What\'s more, a local child specialist, Dr Muzaffar Ghangro, has been arrested on charges of spreading Aids through syringes.He has denied the charge, saying all the infected people were not his patients.\nImage copyright\nAFP\nImage caption\nDr Muzaffar Ghangro was arrested on suspicion of spreading Aids by re-using syringes at his clinic - a claim he denies\nMeanwhile, officials in Sindh - which has one of the highest HIV infection rates in Pakistan - have set up an inquiry to identify causes of the outbreak.But that will not help those who have already found themselves with a diagnosis that will impact on their whole lives.Doctors at the hospital camp in Ratto Dero have now tested more than 18,418 people since 25 April.At least 607 of them have tested positive so far, three-quarters of them children between the ages of one month and 15 years.That means there are hundreds of parents left counting the cost - both to their children\'s health, and their everyday existence."Medicines for grown-ups are usually available [with health authorities] in Larkana, but for the child\'s medicines we have to go to Karachi, which means we spend several thousand rupees on each trip," one mother, whose three-year-old daughter had been diagnosed as HIV-positive, told the BBC.

He is accused of participating in one of the largest ever leaks of government secrets, which could result in a prison term of up to five years.The 47-year-old whistleblower is already facing moves to extradite him to Sweden.In 2010, a Swedish woman accused him of rape after they met at a WikiLeaks conference in Stockholm. Assange has always denied the allegations, and sought refuge in Ecuador\'s embassy for seven years to avoid a British extradition order to Sweden.\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device\nMedia captionJulian Assange being dragged from the Ecuadorean embassy in London\nThe charges were dropped in 2017, but on Monday prosecutors issued a renewed request to hold Mr Assange on suspicion of rape - a first step towards seeking his extradition.Swedish deputy director of public prosecutions, Eva-Marie Persson, said in a statement a request had been filed with the Uppsala district court to have Assange detained in his absence.\n\'Reckless hacktivist\' or campaigner for truth?\nHow likely is a conviction in US?\nShe added that once the court had granted the request, she would then ask British authorities to transfer Assange to Sweden.Mr Assange was arrested on 11 April after being handed over to British authorities by Ecuador. He is serving a 50-week sentence in Belmarsh prison for skipping his extradition order.Correction 21 May 2019: A previous version of this article stated that Julian Assange\'s possessions had been handed over to the US. This has been amended to clarify that they have been seized by the Ecuadorean authorities following a US request.Correction 4th June 2019: This article has been amended to remove a reference to "rape charges".\nRelated TopicsEcuadorSwedenWikileaksUnited StatesJulian Assange\nShare this story\nAbout\xa0sharing\nEmail\nFacebook\nMessenger\nMessenger\nTwitter\nPinterest\nWhatsApp\nLinkedIn\nMore on this story\nJulian Assange doesn\'t consent to US extradition, court hears\n2 May 2019\nWikileaks: Document dumps that shook the world\n12 April 2019\nTop Stories\nJavid knocked out of Tory leadership contest\nBoris Johnson leads the race to be next Tory leader while Michael Gove overtakes Jeremy Hunt to move into second place.\n20 June 2019\nTory leadership race final ballot\n19 June 2019\nAbuse claims \'horrendous\' says former MP\n20 June 2019\nFeatures\nHow my sleepy hometown became a violent crime hotspot\nWhere giving vaccines can get you killed\nVideo\nChina\'s vanishing beards and mosques\nThe cafe where customers don\'t have to pay\nThe fake minister in a silicone mask who stole millions\nBrexit: Where do Conservative leadership candidates stand?\nVideo\nHow a four-day week has changed our lives\nWhy it\'s so hard to stop a cult\nVideo\nFighting vaccine fears in the UK\nElsewhere on the BBC\nEqual Playing Field\nBreaking world records to get women into football\nFull article Equal Playing Field\nDaily news briefing direct to your inbox\nSign up for our newsletter\nFull article Daily news briefing direct to your inbox\nWhy you can trust BBC News\nBBC News Navigation\nEurope\nSections\nEurope\nEuropean Elections 2019\nHome\nUK\nUK Home\nEngland\nN.

In a charity shop in Withington, he found an England Italia 90 away shirt for £5, and had the basis of his outfit. Short of money, he put the shirt on eBay a couple of days later and was surprised to see it sell for £50.\nHe calls it the lightbulb moment. On Doug\'s course was Matt Dale, who also loved football and had dreamed of buying and selling shirts to build a collection. The two of them met and spoke about their shared passion. Neither was particularly enamoured with entering the corporate world, and so explored the prospect of joining forces. An idea was born. So too was Classic Football Shirts (CFS).The pair had a friend who hastily made them a website, and by the time they graduated later that year they were stockpiling football shirts in their student house in Fallowfield. Every spare minute and penny was spent scouring online for shirts available at knockdown prices that could be sold with the sole intention of buying more. "Me and my brother watched Champions League football growing up," says Gary Bierton, Doug\'s brother, who now helps run the company. "Everyone else had the Manchester United home shirt, but my brother would have the third shirt from some weird and wonderful foreign team. You could find those shirts in the back of magazines, but not if you were going shopping with your mum and dad. That\'s where the curiosity stemmed from."The first few months were pretty terrible. I remember going to watch Liverpool play Manchester United at Old Trafford and went to their house before the game. At 15, I remember having more money than them. "They were almost malnourished, eating basic food, because everything was spent on shirts. There were no sales, no money, a grey Manchester sky and them just buried away in this student house."But they were so resolute. In any normal company, you have to satisfy other people\'s terms. This was just two people doing something they love, on their terms, with the excitement of handling football shirts. "They sat in the living room all day on laptops searching, buying and selling. We would go on nights out, come back at 3am, pick the laptop up and start working."\nOne weekend, everything changed. Matt and Doug had found a collector willing to sell his complete collection of Manchester United kits from the 1980s to the present season, and paid for it with a single match-worn Mark Hughes shirt they also found online. From then on, the collection only grew in value. Gary is more than happy to admit that their timing was incredibly fortuitous. In 2006, e-commerce was becoming dominant but there was no obvious outlet for vintage football shirts. Football\'s commercialisation had led to an explosion of kit sponsorship deals and Premier League clubs were starting to release three new kits every year. With the designs and fabrics only getting more formulaic, a nostalgic appetite for older, more individual styles grew. Nostalgia often works in 20-year hindsight. In 2006, that meant World Cup 86 leading to Euro 88 leading to Italia 90, football Enlightenment. Ask any collector for their top five, and almost all will include a shirt from that period. But it goes beyond pure nostalgia. To those who adore and obsess over them, football shirts provide a connection to their club that has been lost somewhere along the way as the football experience, particularly at the top level, has become increasingly homogenised."I think every football fan has that moment that sealed the deal for them," Gary says. "The moment or match that turned football from something you followed to something you obsessed over. That works for every team and every supporter. "And typically, people prefer nostalgia over what\'s happening currently; some vague idea that things were better before. "The shirt is the link to that. You see the shirt, you remember the moment. It gives you a brief second of the initial rush all over again. We\'ve had grown men walk into the big stock room and burst into tears because it takes them to a special place."\nIf this astonishing collection has formed through a series of fortunate, bizarre twists of fate, the most memorable came through an Italian named Ettore. He was a kit obsessive who had longed to help the team and so rang around Italian football clubs and shops in the hope of finding available stock. Ettore learned that AC Milan had a huge amount of old kit that they were prepared to part with."Nothing prepared us for what we found in Milan," Gary says. "You learn that they have this stuff, but cannot imagine it. "It was almost too much, like the world had become a simulation. There were Beckham\'s personalised pants sat next to Andriy Shevchenko\'s Champions League final shirt. "On that day, with the realisation that every club might have a similar situation, we knew that things were going to get much bigger - and quickly."Walking into the warehouse literally takes my breath away; the sheer breadth and volume of the collection is truly unique. CFS have 25,000 vintage shirts listed on their website, plus 9,000 lines of clearance stock. Their match-worn player collection adds another 15,000 shirts. In total, the estimation - and there is no exact figure - stands at around 75,000 individual products that totals more than a million units of stock. This is no Aladdin\'s cave; it\'s Aladdin\'s mansion. If CFS\'s website allows them to buy and sell shirts, this is about far more than that. The aim is to build up their extensive collection of items that will never be sold, simultaneously creating the largest archive of rare football shirts in the world in order to preserve and exhibit a part of football\'s culture that might otherwise be spread across thousands of individual collectors. There is talk of a museum. I ask the obvious question: which items make them most proud?"The holy grail is Argentina\'s away shirt from 1986," Gary says. "About a year ago we got one of the substitute\'s shirts from the quarter-final against England. Argentina didn\'t have an away kit that they liked, so they went to a local sports shop in Mexico which was selling Le Coq Sportif teamwear that was basically PE kit for school. "To think that you\'ve got the team that won the World Cup wearing a kit that they got from a Mexican sports shop is incredible. That\'s not about financial value, it\'s about how much it means and about the sheer rarity of it. It shouldn\'t even exist.\nDiego Maradona sporting Argentina\'s hastily-bought second kit in Mexico in 1986"We also recently got Cristiano Ronaldo\'s Sporting shirt from the second half against Manchester United in a friendly match; they signed him immediately afterwards. Sporting wore their home shirt in the first half, but this special gold shirt after the break. That\'s actually the last shirt he ever wore before going to United. That\'s a keeper."CFS have been able to increase their match-worn collection through forging relationships with former players and the PFA. Some retired footballers might wish to keep all of their shirts and those swapped with opponents, but most prefer to keep hold of a few particular items - debut shirt, high-profile opponent, memorable matches. Via this route, they have acquired pieces that they could never have dreamed of, including suit jackets with tactical formations, dry cleaning tickets and even love letters still in the pockets. But the tale of their first footballer collection is the most remarkable.\nReal Madrid official suit jacket, Netherlands Euro 88 home shirt, Brazil 1970 home shirt, Milan home shirt 1996-97"We saw a guy selling United States shirts from the 80s and 90s on eBay," Gary recalls. "We contacted him and he knew nothing about football, but had bought a storage lot that had unpaid rent at blind auction. "The storage lot had belonged to a guy called Des Armstrong, who won 81 caps for the United States. It had shirts, but also photographs from pitchside at Italia 90 and all sorts of personal memorabilia. "So we bought it all and then contacted Des. He had no problem with us having the shirts, but was incredibly grateful that we could gift him back his memorabilia. Things like that will stick with you forever."Speaking to Gary, one thing is obvious: none of this would be possible without their love and obsession for what they do. From watching old Champions League matches in damp student houses to making videos about their shirts with Gareth Bale and Gary Lineker, it is an incredible journey, but this is still just a group of friends who react like children at Christmas when a new source of potential items is identified and explored. Anyone who collects anything, from porcelain dogs to stamps to autographs, knows that rush. And it never goes away."It feels brand new because every day you are constantly discovering new things," says Gary. "We are always on the hunt. "In 20 years, we\'ll probably all be married and divorced because we think about football shirts too much. It\'s a hobby that has gone out of control and turned into an obsession. And there\'s one conclusion that dawned on us a long time ago: We are completists in an area where 100% doesn\'t exist."\nShare\nthis page\nShare this with\nDigg\nFacebook\nGoogle\nLinkedIn\nReddit\nStumbleUpon\nTwitter\nCopy this link http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/48099640 Read more about sharing.\nTop Stories\nAustralia turn screw on Bangladesh - clips, radio & text\nLive\nFrom the section Cricket\nRead more on Australia turn screw on Bangladesh - clips, radio & text\nWatch: Fifa Women\'s World Cup - Netherlands 0-0 Canada - Dutch top group as it stands\nLive\nFrom the section Football\nRead more on Watch: Fifa Women\'s World Cup - Netherlands 0-0 Canada - Dutch top group as it stands\nWatch: Fifa Women\'s World Cup - Cameroon 0-0 New Zealand - both need win to avoid exit\nLive\nFrom the section Football\nRead more on Watch: Fifa Women\'s World Cup - Cameroon 0-0 New Zealand - both need win to avoid exit\nRelated to this story\nListen: That Peter Crouch Podcast\n18 Sep\nRead more on Listen: That Peter Crouch Podcast\nDownload and listen to the Football Daily podcast\n16 Aug\nRead more on Download and listen to the Football Daily podcast\nAlso in Sport\nThe quirky stats of the Cricket World Cup Comedian Andy Zaltzman digs into the stats to show why South Africa have been a disappointment in the World Cup, and why Mark Wood is a statistical bolt from the blue.\nWatch England captain Morgan hit record 17 sixes\n\'Sam Kerr has scored them all\' - Aussie superstar hits four\nWomen\'s World Cup: Who needs what?\n\'Meeting Royal surgeon proved pivotal\' - Murray on \'life-changing\' operation\nRivals on the field, friends off it - fans light up India-Pakistan match\n\'One of the best saves at any Women\'s World Cup ever\'\nWorld sport: 10 photos we liked this week\nFive key questions for Chelsea after Sarri exit\n\'I was addicted to drugs, now I\'m addicted to running\'\nWoods hoping for 10 more years at the top of golf\nThe lost lionesses - England\'s forgotten teenage football trailblazers\nExplore the BBC\nCould you solve this maths problem?

  'Clinc raises $52M Series B as it marches toward IPO – TechCrunch\nClinc raises $52M Series B as it marches toward IPO\nMatt Burns\n@mjburnsy\n/\n1 month\nAnn Arbor, Mich.-based Clinc is today announcing a $52 million Series B. The company behind the conversational AI platform netted cash from Insight Partners, DFJ Growth, Drive Capital, Hyde Park Venture Partners and others.\nThis round of financing brings Clinc’s total amount of funding to $60 million and will help Clinc scale its conversational AI to new markets. Clinc plans to reach 140 employees by the end of 2019 and intends to move into a new 26,000-square-foot office in Ann Arbor. According to Clinc, the company achieved a 300% year-over-year revenue growth and expects to more than triple the business again this year.\n“We’ve had phenomenal growth and built unbelievable momentum in a very short period of time,” said Jason Mars,\nClinc CEO. “Now we’re adding more world-class investors to support our growing team as we work to accelerate the pace of innovation and to reshape the conversational AI landscape, one industry at a time.”\nMars explained to TechCrunch that it sought specific investors for this round that could help take the company to its initial public offering. Jeff Lieberman, Insight Partners’ managing director, is joining Clinc’s board of directors and brings significant IPO experience to the boardroom as he previously helped several companies go public, including Event, Shutterstock and Website Pros. With this round, Clinc also adds DFJ’s Randy Glein to its board of advisors.\nMars said this round of financing could be its last before going public. He hopes to take the company straight to an IPO from here and noted that the capital gives the company several years of runway.\nWith this round, Clinc now has investors on both coasts, along with the middle of the country, where it’s based.\nClinc was founded in Ann Arbor in 2015 and has remained committed to the Midwest city since its launch. The company currently has offices elsewhere, including Europe, Asia and throughout the States. CEO Mars tells TechCrunch that the short-term plan is to keep key management in Ann Arbor, but it’s plausible that other offices will eventually have more staff.\nThe company’s conversational AI platform is unique in the industry and has allowed the company to make inroads in different markets. Its deep neural network product can be trained to work in a variety of industries, and Clinc currently works with major banks, automakers, quick-service restaurants and healthcare companies. The company recently showed off how it could work in video games, too.\nClinc showed off its system at TechCrunch Disrupt SF 2018. Watch his demo here.',

God rest your soul. Thank you for being a bright light in my life. I will always be here for your family should they ever need me. Love you man."Lauda competed in a total of 171 F1 races, winning 25 of them and claiming 54 podium finishes.\'The most courageous act of any sportsman\' - tributes to Niki Lauda\'A remarkable life lived in Technicolor\'\'A super guy\'Lauda, one of the best-known figures in motorsport, almost died following a crash in the 1976 German Grand Prix at the Nurburgring.Despite suffering severe burns and inhaling hot toxic fumes, he made a remarkable recovery and resumed racing just 40 days later, and went on to win his second world title the following year.In 1978 he went on to race for Bernie Ecclestone\'s Brabham team.Ecclestone, who ran F1 for nearly 40 years until January 2017, described Lauda as a "super guy".\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nThis video has been removed for rights reasons\n"It is quite amazing firstly that he lived after the accident and then to come back as quickly as he did," Ecclestone told BBC Sport."I sat with him before the first race he came back at Monza, and he came back from practice, took his helmet off and there was blood running down his face because obviously nothing was healing properly."So he had that patched up a bit, put the helmet back on and finished qualifying - so that\'s Niki."Niki was loved all over the world, I don\'t think he did anything bad to anybody."Australian Mark Webber, who competed in F1 between 2002 and 2013, ending his career at Red Bull, told BBC Radio 5 Live Lauda was "an absolute icon of our sport and there is a huge hole in our sport because of his passing".He added: "Niki was a warrior, an entrepreneur and humble. He was extremely uncomplicated, that was one of his biggest strengths. A spade was a spade and he backed that up with his words and vision."He showed great bravery in 1976 to come back and compete with horrendous injuries. "Because he had a fascination with aviation, he was a risk taker. He pushed the boundaries and openly said, \'why are we here if we are not going to push limits?\'"He was incredibly crafty and clever, which most great sports people are. He was calm, aggressive when he needed to be, calculated and stood his ground. That is how he was successful."Monger inspired by Lauda adviceBilly Monger says advice from Lauda helped inspire him in his comeback to motor racing after having both his legs amputated.Monger, 20, was seriously injured during a Formula 4 race at Donington Park in April 2017 but claimed his first victory since the accident by winning the Pau Grand Prix on Sunday.Monger said on The One Show: "I had the opportunity to meet Niki back at the 2017 British Grand Prix, when I was a guest of Lewis [Hamilton], a few months after my accident."I was so early on in my recovery that, although I wanted to get back racing, I didn\'t know whether it would be possible or not."He gave me some really strong words of advice - if it\'s something you really want to do, don\'t let anyone stand in your way, just work as hard as you can at it.

Programming director Mike McKenzie said broadcasting it would break parents\' trust in the network.In a statement, Mr McKenzie said "parents trust that their children can watch APT without their supervision", and that children "younger than the \'target\' audience" might watch without parental knowledge.\nShow creator WGBH and broadcaster PBS reportedly alerted local stations in April about the episode, and Mr McKenzie said this was when they decided not to air the show. US cartoon\'s gay wedding praisedArthur is a joint Canadian/American series which debuted in 1996 about an eight-year-old anthropomorphic aardvark named Arthur Read and his friends, who live in the fictional Elwood City. APT previously refused to broadcast a 2005 episode of the series which depicted Buster, a rabbit, visiting a girl who had two mothers. Substitute teacher Misty Souder told news website AL.com that she and her daughter were disappointed the episode did not run and had contacted the network about it. "I never thought I\'d be going to battle for a gay rat wedding, but here we are," she said. A 2018 Gallup poll showed 46% of people in Alabama identified as conservative, second only to Mississippi among all 50 states.

The true impact to Huawei may be enormous. While we often refer to the firm's devices as simply “Chinese”, the reality is much more complicated - it sources parts and expertise from all over the world. The same can be said for the likes of Apple, of course, which relies at least in part on chips created by its rival, Samsung.To get an idea of how disruptive the US move is, let's take a look at just one component of one device: the motherboard in Huawei’s flagship smartphone, the P30 Pro. It's a circuit board that is barely the length of a finger - but one that relies on a web of complex supply chains and sourcing to make it possible and affordable.\nImage copyright\niFixIt\nImage caption\nOne side of the P30 Pro motherboard (picture provided by iFixIt.com)\nThe P30 Pro’s RF transceivers (1) and audio chip (4, below) are made by HiSilicon, a China-based company wholly owned by Huawei - but that’s where the homegrown tech ends.\nThe chip’s front end module (2) - which makes it able to engage with mobile network signals - is designed and manufactured by Skyworks, a semiconductor firm based in Massachusetts, USA, that falls under the US restrictions. An additional front end module (3) to handle different radio frequencies is made by Qorvo, a semiconductor firm headquartered in Greensboro, North Carolina. It is also affected by the ban.\nImage copyright\nIFixIt\nImage caption\nThe flipside, showing an American-made flash storage chip (Picture provided by iFixIt.com)\nOn the reverse side, the flash storage (5) is designed by Micron Technologies, a 40-year-old semiconductor specialist based in Idaho, USA. This component means the P30 has 128GB of space on which to install the phone’s software - as well as space for the phone’s user to store pictures, video and so on. According to figures, some 13% of Micron’s annual revenue comes from supplying Huawei. And finally, you can see DRAM (6) (dynamic random access memory) designed and manufactured by SK Hynix, a South Korean firm that also supplies components to Apple and others. SK Hynix is not affected by the US restrictions, but there are diplomatic troubles here too: China has reportedly raised concerns that SK Hynix and other South Korean chipmakers are working together to drive up prices to China in order to capitalise on their expertise. The companies deny this.Unpredictable futureThis is just one motherboard, in one device. Last year, Huawei released a list of its core suppliers and it included 33 US companies. As well as Google having to pull back on supplying its version of Android, major US technology suppliers including Xilinx, Qualcomm, Broadcom and Intel have all warned they will need to stop selling their technology to Huawei in order to comply with the ban. NeoPhotonics, a San Jose-based firm which makes networking equipment, has a contract with Huawei that represents 44% of its entire revenue. On Monday, the US Commerce Department issued a temporary licence that enabled some companies to continue supporting existing networks and devices - but longer term, it’s an unstable, unpredictable future for the cooperation between American and Chinese innovators. Analysts predict the decision could encourage China’s desire to build more technology within its own borders. That would be a difficult, costly, and in some areas sub-par, move to take. But long-term it would give China a chance to set its own standards on future technologies.\nThat would hasten what some are referring to as the Balkanisation of the digital age: two separate internets that would each require different technologies in order to use them._______Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBCDo you have more information about this or any other technology story?

  'This clever transforming robot flies and rolls on its rotating arms – TechCrunch\nThis clever transforming robot flies and rolls on its rotating arms\nDevin Coldewey\n@techcrunch\n/\n1 month\nThere’s great potential in using both drones and ground-based robots for situations like disaster response, but generally these platforms either fly or creep along the ground. Not the “Flying STAR,” which does both quite well, and through a mechanism so clever and simple you’ll wish you’d thought of it.\nConceived by researchers at Ben-Gurion University in Israel, the “flying sprawl-tuned autonomous robot” is based on the elementary observation that both rotors and wheels spin. So why shouldn’t a vehicle have both?\nWell, there are lots of good reasons why it’s difficult to create such a hybrid, but the team, led by David Zarrouk, overcame them with the help of today’s high-powered, lightweight drone components. The result is a robot that can easily fly when it needs to, then land softly and, by tilting the rotor arms downwards, direct that same motive force into four wheels.\nOf course you could have a drone that simply has a couple of wheels on the bottom that let it roll along. But this improves on that idea in several ways. In the first place, it’s mechanically more efficient because the same motor drives the rotors and wheels at the same time — though when rolling, the RPMs are of course considerably lower. But the rotating arms also give the robot a flexible stance, large wheelbase and high clearance that make it much more capable on rough terrain.\nYou can watch FSTAR fly, roll, transform, flatten and so on in the following video, prepared for presentation at the IEEE International Convention on Robotics and Automation in Montreal:\nThe ability to roll along at up to 8 feet per second using comparatively little energy, while also being able to leap over obstacles, scale stairs or simply ascend and fly to a new location, give FSTAR considerable adaptability.\n“We plan to develop larger and smaller versions to expand this family of sprawling robots for different applications, as well as algorithms that will help exploit speed and cost of transport for these flying/driving robots,” said Zarrouk in a press release.\nObviously at present this is a mere prototype, and will need further work to bring it to a state where it could be useful for rescue teams, commercial operations and the military.',

But House Judiciary Committee chairman Jerry Nadler said their subpoenas "are not optional" and said they would hear Mr McGahn\'s testimony "even if we have to go to court to secure it".\nImage copyright\nAFP\nImage caption\nDon McGahn left the White House in October\nDemocratic Party leaders have so far held off pressure from their lawmakers to begin impeachment proceedings, and the party is divided over the merits of the move, but the pressure is growing as the president stonewalls congressional inquiries. Democratic representative Mark Pocan - one of the leaders of the party\'s progressive wing - said the president\'s latest moves had enhanced his "appearance of guilt" and "pushed Congress to a point where we must start an impeachment inquiry"."We need to do our job and vote on impeachment," tweeted Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.And Republican congressman Justin Amash broke ranks, tweeting that the president\'s behaviour met "the threshold for impeachment" but he has been criticised by fellow party members. Asked about impeachment on Tuesday, Democratic House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, said: "I don\'t think we\'re there at this point in time." Why did McGahn not testify?A letter to the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee said Mr McGahn was "absolutely immune from compelled Congressional testimony" and said Mr Trump had directed him not to appear on Tuesday.Mr McGahn - who resigned after almost two years as White House counsel in October 2018 - said he would respect the president\'s instruction.In the wake of Mr McGahn\'s failure to appear, Mr Nadler announced he had issued subpoenas to former White House Communications Director Hope Hicks and Annie Donaldson, Mr McGahn\'s former chief of staff.According to a New York Times report, Democratic lawmakers and aides were examining possible rules changes to allow the House to fine people held in contempt, as well as other means to break the impasse.Presidential administrations have challenged subpoenas before, but analysts say President Trump\'s vow to block all subpoenas issued by the House Judiciary Committee in relation to the Mueller report is unprecedented. What is this about?The subpoena for Mr McGahn\'s testimony is part of a wider inquiry by Congressional Democrats into Mr Trump\'s alleged obstruction and abuse of power.In March, the House Judiciary Committee issued document requests related to the investigation of 81 people and groups.Mr McGahn was interviewed for 30 hours by Mr Mueller\'s team of investigators, and was frequently cited in their 448-page report, released in April.\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device\nMedia captionThe Mueller report - in 60 seconds\nMr Trump later said he had authorised this co-operation with Mr Mueller. The Mueller report detailed how Mr McGahn felt the president had pressured him to fire Mr Mueller and, later, write a memo saying that Mr Trump had issued no such directive. US Attorney General William Barr was questioned this month about the matter by Senate Democrats.Mr Barr said the president had only suggested that Mr Mueller be "replaced" because of a perceived conflict of interest - and then instructed Mr McGahn to correct inaccurate media reports.Mr McGahn left the White House in October to return to a Washington law firm, Jones Day, which represents the Trump campaign.\nRelated TopicsDonald TrumpUnited StatesDemocratic PartyRussia-Trump inquiry\nShare this story\nAbout\xa0sharing\nEmail\nFacebook\nMessenger\nMessenger\nTwitter\nPinterest\nWhatsApp\nLinkedIn\nMore on this story\nTrump-Russia probe: Barr assigns prosecutor to review inquiry\n14 May 2019\nVideo\nMueller report: \'Barr spinning investigation\' - Nadler\n18 April 2019\nMueller report: Eight things we only just learned\n18 April 2019\nTop Stories\nJavid knocked out of Tory leadership contest\nBoris Johnson leads the race to be next Tory leader while Michael Gove overtakes Jeremy Hunt to move into second place.\n20 June 2019\nTory leadership race final ballot\n19 June 2019\nAbuse claims \'horrendous\' says former MP\n20 June 2019\nFeatures\nHow my sleepy hometown became a violent crime hotspot\nWhere giving vaccines can get you killed\nVideo\nChina\'s vanishing beards and mosques\nThe cafe where customers don\'t have to pay\nThe fake minister in a silicone mask who stole millions\nBrexit: Where do Conservative leadership candidates stand?\nVideo\nHow a four-day week has changed our lives\nWhy it\'s so hard to stop a cult\nVideo\nFighting vaccine fears in the UK\nElsewhere on the BBC\nEqual Playing Field\nBreaking world records to get women into football\nFull article Equal Playing Field\nDaily news briefing direct to your inbox\nSign up for our newsletter\nFull article Daily news briefing direct to your inbox\nWhy you can trust BBC News\nBBC News Navigation\nUS & Canada\nHome\nUK\nUK Home\nEngland\nN.
