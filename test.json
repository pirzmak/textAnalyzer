Subscribe here.\nEarlier this week at WWDC, I finally got a chance to sit down and actually use iPadOS on an iPad Pro. The purpose of the meeting was ostensibly to walk me through the new features, but I greedily grabbed the iPad and started tapping, swiping, and opening web pages — listening and talking about what was new all the while. Turns out that, just like the new OS on the iPad, I can multitask better than I expected.\nJamming through the new features on iPadOS was like a greatest hits album of iPad Pro complaints that have been resolved. External USB drives, direct access to drives for Lightroom, and a desktop-class browser all felt like direct responses to our iPad Pro review last year.\nOther annoying things have also been fixed, too. For example, you can finally (finally!) directly change Wi-Fi networks and Bluetooth devices right from the appropriate buttons in Control Center. Apple is also finally bringing quick actions and pop-up web previews to the iPad — thanks in part to its decision to basically merge 3D touch and long-presses.\nVjeran Pavic / The Verge\nBut as I mentioned when I wrote about how Google Docs worked surprisingly well in Safari, I walked away from my brief time with iPadOS unsure exactly how much Apple has really changed. Did it simply fix all the things people have complained about for years, one-by-one? Or is Apple trying to architect a more fundamental overhaul that would make the iPad feel much less constrained by design?\nYou can certainly argue it both ways, based on what we’ve seen so far. For example, Apple completely changed how the USB stack works in iOS, ensuring it’s properly sandboxed in user space, while building in support for several different USB protocols. It should be fairly trivial for Apple to expand that in powerful ways going forward.\nI’m similarly pleased with the much-simplified cursor control system on the iPad for text editing. One clever thing you might not have seen: if you move your finger really quickly outside the text when moving the cursor, it gets gigantified so you can see where it is and makes it easier to quickly move it to a different paragraph.\nI also see a lot of effort going into the iPad’s new windowing system. Yes, the basics of how you arrange windows are the same: split screen and slideover. But the ability to fan out those slideover apps or swipe through them turns a sort-of-nice feature into what amounts to having a spare iPhone sitting on the right hand side of your screen. And since apps can spawn multiple windows, Apple added the ability to get an overview of each app’s open windows quickly, which creates a new kind of multitasking workflow.\nVjeran Pavic / The Verge\nOf course, all these windowing tricks are only good if apps support them — and right now, many key iPad apps do not (looking at you, Google). But Apple tells me that sometime next year it will change the rules so that supporting the iPadOS window system will be mandatory for all iPad apps. I’m glad.\nBut ever since Monday, I’ve kept coming back to the same idea: the new gestures that Apple added are really great but feel a little tacked-on. You can use three fingers to do a bunch of “manipulation” stuff: pinch and spread for copy and paste, swipe for undo or redo. They make sense when you learn them, but you really do have to learn them in a way that wasn’t necessary before.\nI don’t think they’re very discoverable. You’d have to do a lot of weird experimentation with multiple fingers to find these new gestures on your own, although Apple tells me it will offer onboarding tutorials for some of them. The company famously made little tutorial videos when it launched the iPhone, but this time around these new power-user gestures are much more complicated and much less easy to figure out on your own.\nVjeran Pavic / The Verge\nWhat I’m getting to is these three-finger gestures are unintuitive, but when I say “unintuitive” I mean something completely different from the common understanding of it. I think that when most people hear “intuitive,” they think “innately understood by humans with no training necessary.” I think that’s wrong, at least when it comes to user interfaces.\nI don’t think any user interface — whether it’s a computer or a bicycle — is the sort of thing that humans just innately understand. Nearly everything we do requires training and learning. The difference between an intuitive interface and an unintuitive one is how that learning happens.\nWith intuitive interfaces, you don’t notice that the learning is happening. One skill flows naturally into the next, more complex skill on a relatively easy learning curve. Take the classic desktop interface: if you step back and look, it’s actually deeply weird! It only feels normal because it’s been around for 35 years. However, it is intuitive: you learn left click, then discover right click, then see keyboard shortcuts listed. Each skill leads somewhat naturally to the next, and there are little hints that these extra tools exist all over the interface, inviting you to try them out whenever you want.\nVjeran Pavic / The Verge\nUnintuitive interfaces require training: like classes or little tutorial videos showing you how to do stuff that you’ll hopefully remember later. As I note in the video above, different types of languages are a good example of intuitive / unintuitive divide. Math as a language is unintuitive for most people: you need to take classes to figure it out. But natural languages like the one you speak are intuitive — at least for children: they learn them without even noticing it’s happening just because their parents talk to them.\nThat doesn’t mean that unintuitive interfaces are inherently bad, either. I want to be super clear about that. If an interface requires you to do a little training but feels internally consistent, you are more likely to remember how things work down the road. And it seems as though the iPadOS user interface does have some consistency, though it’s not perfect yet:\nOne finger: open or make a window with the thing you’re tapping or dragging\nTwo fingers: select stuff (right now this only works in lists I believe? Apple should expand that)\nThree fingers: act the thing I’ve selected, or undo my last act\nFour fingers: Go home\nThis seems like it has the potential to be a durable, flexible, and powerful user interface system, one that can work really well for people picking up an iPad for the first time and for power users who are replacing their laptops with iPads. But the real trick is having the interface teach people to go from the first group to the second group without having to focus on teaching themselves how iPadOS works.\nMaybe I’m wrong, and when we see more people using it beyond the developers who are brave enough to install the first beta, these advanced gestures will come really naturally. If they don’t, that doesn’t mean the new gestures are bad — but it might mean they’re not very intuitive.\nThe Verge on YouTube\nExclusive first looks at new tech, reviews, and shows like In the Making.\nSubscribe!\nIn this Storystream\nWWDC 2019: the latest news from Apple’s big developer conference\nApple’s new sign-in button is built for a post-Cambridge Analytica world\niPadOS impressions: flexible and powerful, but is it intuitive?\nApple will permanently remove Dashboard in macOS Catalina\nView all 42 stories\nNext Up In\nTech\nGood Deals\nYou can still save $200 on a Samsung Galaxy S10E\nNew deals, plus a few Father’s Day offers that are still active\nGoogle’s loud Home Max speaker is $40 off for Verge readers\nA handful of exclusive deals for you\nThe Google Pixel 3 and 3 XL are $300 off at B&H Photo\nThe sale price is limited to 64GB, ‘not pink’ models\nHollow Knight for $7.50 on the Switch is E3 2019’s best deal\nPlay this game\nAdding a 512GB microSD card to your Nintendo Switch is cheaper than ever\nStarting at $80.99, today only\nMore in Good Deals\nVerge3.0_Logomark_Color_1\nSign up for the\nnewsletter\nCommand Line\nCommand Line delivers daily updates from the near-future.\nemail address...\nSubscribe\nBy signing up, you agree to our Privacy Policy and European users agree to the data transfer policy.\nThis Article has a component height of 36.

  'Is a $600 smart oven ever worth it? – TechCrunch\nIs a $600 smart oven ever worth it?\nBrian Heater\n@bheater\n/\n4 weeks\nPart of closely following tech is the often mistaken belief that newer, better technologies can help right some of the wrongs older ones caused in the first place. Behold the Wii and the Fitbit — two perfect examples of technologies designed to right some of technologies’ previous wrongs.\nIt’s tricky because, in some cases, these things do work. We’ve all read the success stories, and for many of us, that’s enough to keep us trying out new things. Some much ultimately relies on our own individual hang ups. If we’re lucky, the right piece of technology at the right time can be legitimately transformative of those things we’d like to change about ourselves.\nWith something like the June, the hope is two-fold. There’s all of the built-in features and the promise of better baking, coupled with the simple motivating factor of spending $599 on a glorified toaster oven. I’ll admit that test driving it only addresses only the first of those two key things, but my hopes were still pretty high that it could help wean me off of my takeout food dependency.\nThing is, I travel a lot for work. Couple that with a long time living in one of the world’s best and most diverse food cities, and that’s a recipe for picking up food nearly every night. I’m sure I don’t need to tell you what that means for my wallet and waste line, not to mention the packing waste that tends to generate. Bad news all the way around.\nOften life gets in the way, as it has with my own testing. This one’s been a little cursed. After a prolonged delay on review units (the second gen oven was announced 10 months ago), I was finally able to get started late last month. Well, after the company sent me a second unit when I discovered the hard way that the first had been damaged in shipping, sending up sparks during my first attempt to cook. I mention that only to say double-check the filaments when you take it out of the box. Perhaps some kind of automotive-like oven health check is in the cards for some future update.\nOne other thing worth mentioning here, at the risk of offering up TMI, is the fact that I rarely left my bed the week before last, over a particularly bad bout with the stomach flu. The nausea and everything else have been bad enough to put me off of the idea of handling raw meat for the intervening week — something that could hopefully be a boon for my longtime flirtations with vegetarianism.\nAs someone who’s never been especially enamored with cooking, the June\ndid help fire up those synapsis in my brain a bit. There’s something in being able to cook something decent with minimal effort, and the June does a good job on that front. Locate a recipe with only a handful of ingredients and a stated five to 10 minute prep time, and that’s a solid baby step. Of course, you can only go outside of June’s suggested recipes, but coloring inside the lines is a probably the best place for a beginner to start.\nSimplicity, coupled with data collection are where the June really shines. Between the constant heat monitoring, the camera and the inclusion of a meat thermometer, the oven is pulling a lot of data to assure you get the right cook. It’s not idiot-proof (sadly for this culinary dummy), and the first time I tried (the working oven), I’d stuck the thermometer too far in, touching the bottom pan and shortening the cooking time to a too brief five minutes (down from 22).\nMake this so idiots like me can use it is probably my main feedback here. Also, though I fully understand why it’s as large as it is, it was still bigger than expected. Which may not mean much to you, if you don’t grapple with the size restrictions of a New York City apartment.\nAnother minor thing, which probably couldn’t be avoided is that plasticky smell that happens with the first several sessions. Based on the June FAQ, I expected it to go away a lot sooner, but was assured it was just a normal part of the baking process.\nFor what it’s worth, the simple dishes came out well, which only means a lot if you know how terrible I am at cooking. It’s a weird mental block, I realize. And I did enjoy the process enough to begin experimenting with things outside of the parameters of the June recipes.\nSmartphone notifications are a nice feature, though I’m not sure any of the smart features are “necessary” per se. Like, take this time-lapse footage of me slightly overcooking chicken breasts:\n[Above: bon appétit?]\nDitto for the image recognition. It does an impressive job mostly identifying the foodstuffs on the tray, but I can’t really foresee a scenario in which you, the chef, is not aware of what you’re cooking before you hit start.\nIt’s a tricky line to walk. You want to add enough features to justify the purchase of a smart oven, while not loading it up with so many that the price becomes unmanageable. June’s definitely taken a step in the right direction with the second gen oven, but for a majority of users, the balance still isn’t quite there.',
  'AdHawk raises $13M as it expands into the flooring industry – TechCrunch\nAdHawk raises $13M as it expands into the flooring industry\nAnthony Ha\n@anthonyha\n/\n2 weeks\nWhy is an adtech startup going after the flooring industry?\nThat was my big question when I got on the phone with AdHawk CEO Todd Saunders and COO Dan Pratt. The company announced earlier this week that it’s raised a $13 million Series B round of funding in conjunction with the launch of a new website, FlooringStores.\n“We look at AdHawk\nas the umbrella company,” Saunders explained. “Our core is a digital marketing company that’s built very strong machine learning. Now FloorForce is the brand we’re using to go after with the flooring vertical.”\nFloorForce is actually a recent AdHawk acquisition, offering a variety of digital services for flooring companies — not just AdHawk’s specialty of Facebook and Google advertising, but also website building, reputation management and chatbots. FlooringStores, meanwhile, is the consumer-facing side of the business, a website where homeowners looking for flooring services can browse different providers\nSaunders said FloorForce’s potential customer base includes the 20,000 independent flooring companies in the United states, all in an industry that, in his words, “hasn’t been touched by technology.”\nPratt added, “The vast majority of these retailers need to be convinced why … websites are important — or if they have one, it was built in 1997, which is obviously a really bad experience for consumers. In the same conversation where we’re pitching these websites for our retailers, we’re talking to them about other opportunities, like chatbots, and the universe of what is possible for these folks is magnified by 10x.”\nUltimately, Saunders and Pratt said they’re hoping to take a similar approach and expand into other home service verticals, all while taking advantage of the consumer data gathered through AdHawk and FloorForce.\nAdHawk’s Series B was led by Entrée Capital, with participation from Table Management, Accomplice and others. The startup has now raised a total of $17.7 million, and Pratt said it’s been growing quickly — going from 30 employees a year ago to more than 100 currently, with the aim of approaching a headcount of 200 by the end of the year.\nAdHawk acquires Automate Ads to improve Google and Facebook ad campaigns',
  'I flew the Millennium Falcon and it was good – TechCrunch\nI flew the Millennium Falcon and it was good\nMatthew Panzarino\n@Panzer\n/\n3 weeks\nAfter visiting Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge several months ago to report on how it was built, I came back on the eve of it opening to the public to try out its first marquee attraction: flying the Millennium Falcon.\nWell, I flew it, and it was good. Real good. This ride is for everyone who dreamed of piloting the Falcon more than they dreamed about holding a lightsaber. This ride is for every person that rode Star Tours shuttle and gripped the slightly up-turned handles wishing hard that they could fly it. It’s a quintessential part of the Star Wars universe made flesh.\nIt’s clever, incredibly well art-directed and absolutely smoothly operational. The ride offers a thrilling group experience that will foster shouting and interaction in the cockpit just as we’ve seen in the movies. It will very likely also breed some post-flight posturing or trash-talking depending on how each individual performs their tasks.\nThe scene setting and queue for the Falcon is pitch perfect. You walk by the ship itself and through a queue that is populated with all the artifacts of an active smuggling operation inside a well-worn, lived-in hangar. As you go through the line you are presented with multiple views of the falcon itself, making utilization of the 100-foot ship.\nA cast member will hand you a boarding card with your preferred role on it, identified by color.\nEventually you enter the insanely familiar chiclet corridor and board the ship. The reveal of the hold with its Dejarik board (not functional but you can sit there and take pics) and a ton of other super accurate details is your next treat. This is where your colored boarding card gets handed in and you board a cockpit through one of two tunnels.\nAfter a quick briefing from Hondo Ohnaka it’s time to enter the cockpit and, friends, the impact is real. It’s the cockpit as you imagined it, only right in your face and extremely tactile. I talked about this before, but the toggles feel right, the levers feel right.\nTechnologically speaking, the Falcon is a beast of an operation.\nIn my piece previewing Galaxy’s Edge a few months ago, I mentioned some technical details about the way the ride works. It’s a simulator with multiple cockpits, loaded with six people in two batches at a time. There are two pilots, two gunners and two engineers. You share responsibility for how the Falcon completes its mission. You’ll always get home, but the ship may be more or less damaged and each person gets a rating that translates into your “share” of galactic credits.\nHere are some details from my earlier piece:\nThe simulation is run on the Unreal engine and the mechanics are a much upgraded version of what powers Star Tours. Each cockpit has its own real‑time rendering system for a multi‑projection feedback hub across five screens that completely surround the cockpit seamlessly. Any decision you make as a member of the crew has to result in an action on screen, and it’s all real time, so none of the major stuff is pre-rendered. While Disney itself was fairly cagey about what powers the “magic” behind this system, Nvidia talked a bit about it last year.\nEach of the cockpits is powered by a single BOXX machine with 8 Nvidia Quadro P6000 GPUs in a Quadro SLI configuration. They sync up with five super-high-res rear projectors that make up a seamless cockpit for the rider. The displays synchronize with each other and with the actions of the people in the cockpit.\nGunners fire (synchronous fire from both gunners is needed to blow up an attacker) blasters, engineers put out fires or handle special operations like grappling and pilots try not to hit stuff (and engage the hyper drive). All of these actions are accomplished by strategically punching buttons or pulling levers during the flight. You are prompted to do each with audible instructions from Hondo, as well as light-up rings and buttons.\nThe whole simulation sits on top of a custom version of Unreal Engine that supports an obvious ton of GPUs. The work that Disney did on the engine went back to Epic Games and will help to inform how their engine ends up handling multiple GPUs in the future.\nIn action, the work has paid off. This is an insanely involved simulator ride handling a bunch of inputs at once.\nI have to say, though, it tickles me pink that Disney spent billions building what reminds me a heck of a lot of a Star Wars version of Spaceteam.\nYes, you can play it in isolation, taking care of your role and that’s it, but just a couple minutes into my flight I was yelling at our (terrible) pilots to go left or right or up or down and the engineers were hollering at my fellow gunner and I to shoot things. If you let yourself get into it, you’re going to have a good time. And there are absolutely cases for multiple runs at this thing; it’s not a one-and-done ride. Different roles, different modes (there is a semi-secret manual gunnery mode you trigger right at the beginning of the ride if you’re quick) and what Disney promises are ongoing stories that will be installed in the ride make it a long-term investment.\nThe controls are responsive, but not “twitch-style.” If you’ve played an advanced space simulator then you know that the scale of everything affects your sense of speed — that’s present here too. The Falcon isn’t a ship that goes snicker snack from one heading to another, it arcs and swerves. This makes moving up and down floatier than flying a tiny fighter might be, but it doesn’t take long to get used to it. I hit maybe two or three things on my pilot flight, where my earlier flight impacted maybe 15 or so times.\nYou’re given a score based on how you performed your role and how the whole flight performed. That translates into galactic credits that you can use in the Disney Play app for rewards. The Play App, as long as it has been logged into and opened, will get your score information from the ride automatically.\nCast members will then be able to see how you performed and tell you to “stay away from Hondo, he’s not going to be happy.” Or when you’re ordering a drink at the Cantina the barkeep might say, “I see that you had a successful run on the Falcon for Hondo.”\nWe also got a bit of a video and audio “extra” after our second flight when we did better score-wise than my first one. I’m not sure if that’s connected to score but I’m going to try to find out. Hondo was certainly more complimentary and there was a real story-based change between the two runs. We “did more” in the second run and “came back with more stuff,” and those things felt connected and visual — it wasn’t just a random score-based level.\nI’ll leave the contents of the flight itself to spoiler territory, but it involved the traditional flying in tight spots, asteroids, shooting down TIE Fighters and entering hyperspace. It was intense, felt like a good length and was very satisfying.\nI’ll have more to come from Galaxy’s Edge in the next few days, stay tuned.\n[gallery ids="1834358,1834412,1834411,1834414,1834417,1834418,1834421,1834424"]',

The governor, Andrew Cuomo, needs to review and sign the bill before it becomes law. Critics say cat declawing - which involves cutting off a segment of the bone attached to the claw -\nis "barbaric and inhumane".But the New York Veterinary Medical Society has argued that it should still be an option when otherwise the cat might be abandoned or put down.\nCat declawing is already illegal in many countries in Europe, including the UK, as well as Brazil, Israel, Australia and New Zealand. Why is it so controversial - and why does it still happen in the US?Why do people declaw their cats?The most frequent type of declawing is called an onychectomy - it involves cutting the bones the claws grow from with a scalpel or laser.Critics compare this to cutting off someone\'s toes or fingers at their top joint, and say declawing can affect a cat\'s balance.There are some cases where the surgery is medically necessary, "if there\'s a bad infection in the nail bed, or a tumour," says Dr Sarah Endersby, veterinary development manager at International Cat Care, a charity.However, she adds, many people declaw cats to stop them from scratching the furniture, which she calls "essentially an act of mutilation done to modify the cat for our benefit". Attitudes differ widely across the Atlantic. While many European countries signed a treaty forbidding the practice in the early 1990s, an AP poll in 2011 found that 55% of US cat owners said it was OK to declaw their cats. Some studies suggest that between 20% and 25% of pet cats in the US have been declawed.\nBy contrast, "declawing was always rare" in the UK, even before it was outlawed in 2006, says Prof Danielle Gunn-Moore, a vet and chair of feline medicine at the University of Edinburgh."It was something we didn\'t get taught at university. It became banned as more Americans came to the UK with declawed cats."Why do the UK and US have such different cat cultures?\nImage caption\nThe UK\'s most famous outdoor cat? Larry - who shares a home with whoever is prime minister\n"A big difference is that many more cats in the US are kept exclusively indoors," says Dr Sarah Ellis, an expert in feline behaviour at International Cat Care.Surveys suggest that only about 20% of pet cats in the UK live completely indoors, and that most owners in Europe also allow their cats outdoors. However, the proportion of indoor cats is thought to be much higher in the US.It\'s something that Judd Birdsall, a cat-lover and former US diplomat who now lives in the UK, noticed."When you go around a village in the UK you see lots of cats outside. I can\'t ever remember seeing a cat outside in the US," he told the BBC.\nThe man who watches thousands of cat videos\n16 things you never knew about cats\nSecret life of the cat\nExperts believe Americans are more likely to keep cats indoors because many live in high-rise buildings in the city. Meanwhile, in rural places in the US, there are more likely to be predators such as coyotes and wolves.Outdoor cats may find more suitable scratching material outside - like trees. It is also unsafe to declaw cats that go outside, as they may need their claws to protect themselves.However, there is also a cultural difference, says Mr Birdsall."For Americans, it\'s a matter of freedom and convenience - the right to the freedom to make decisions in terms of how you raise your cat, and convenience, because once you remove the claws, you don\'t ever have to worry about you or the furniture getting scratched.""By contrast, in the UK, any concerns for freedom and convenience are vastly dwarfed by concern to the welfare of the cat - it\'s unthinkable to declaw cats in Europe."\nAre indoor or outdoor cats better off?\nImage copyright\nGetty Images\nImage caption\nIndoor cats tend to live longer - but need a suitable environment\nIndoor cats tend to have longer lifespans, because they are less likely to get hit by cars or encounter feline viruses.\nHowever, indoor cats need good environmental enrichment - otherwise they are much more likely to develop psychological problems\nIndoor cats in multiple-cat households are more likely to experience stress-related disorders if they don\'t get on, because cats are naturally solitary animals\nOutdoor cats can express their inherent behaviour more readily, such as hunting and playing with bugs\nVets say outdoor cats can appear braver, and more psychologically balanced, as they are challenged multiple times a day\nHowever in rural parts of the US outdoor cats are much more likely to encounter predators\nSources: Prof Gunn-Moore, Steve Dale, International Cat Care\nWhy is declawing so controversial?Many experts say studies suggest that declawed cats are more likely to have health problems, such as back pain, or behavioural problems, such as aggression."Some studies suggest cats who have been declawed have a higher percentage of cortisol [the stress hormone], which is often associated with pain," says Steve Dale, an animal behaviour consultant and pet journalist in Chicago.Meanwhile, a study that scanned declawed cat paws found that "very few people actually do it properly - the procedure tends to leave bone fragments," says Prof Gunn-Moore, adding that this could leave cats stepping on tiny fragments of bone when they walk.\nDr Endersby says that cats can continue to feel pain after the declawing procedure. "Part of its weight is borne on its toes - so after the declawing process their gait changes as they put their weight through their paws."However, Dr Drew Weigner, a vet in Atlanta who works on a foundation that funds feline medical research, cautions that "behavioural studies are notoriously difficult to accomplish successfully".Many vets, he argues, simply consider the procedure unethical now because it\'s an unnecessary procedure.\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device\nMedia captionShakes-purr-rean cat at Stratford-upon-Avon cafe\nAre there situations where declawing should be permitted?Many US veterinary societies are opposed to a ban because they say declawing should be allowed as a last resort, if the owner would otherwise decide to abandon their cat.In the UK, Prof Gunn-Moore says she has only ever declawed two cats, when an elderly client was not allowed into her care home with her cats unless she could guarantee they would not scratch the furniture.As the care home wouldn\'t accept any other options, and as the cats were too shy to be re-homed, Prof Gunn-Moore contacted the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons, who gave her permission to perform the procedure in this instance."I undertook the procedure on the grounds of stopping two cats from being euthanized, and the lady from losing her cats, but it sickened me the entire time". Declawing "has to be an absolute last resort", she says, adding that most people declaw their cats for more frivolous reasons. "A lot of people can\'t be bothered to put the effort into training their cats - or don\'t want a scratching post in their flat."Some people just like the way the paws look - I\'ve had people tell me their feet look cuter and fluffier when declawed."\nImage copyright\nGetty Images\nImage caption\nCats like using long, wooden objects as scratching posts\nMeanwhile, some vets have argued that declawing can be necessary when their owners have health issues that put them at risk.One vet told the Denver Post back in 2013: "When my own husband was in chemotherapy and his immune system was compromised, I declawed my cat. I love her dearly, but I wasn\'t going to take the chance that he might get an infection if she scratched him."However, the latest advice from the Centers for Disease Control does not recommend that patients declaw their cats - it simply advises that the cats are kept indoors, with "rough play" avoided.Are things changing in the US?They certainly seem to be. In addition to the proposed legislation in New York, individual cities such as Los Angeles and Denver have also banned declawing. "Twenty years ago it was considered something you do - you get a cat, you declaw them,"\nsays Dr Weigner. However, he argues that in recent years declawing has become "an increasingly controversial procedure... we stopped declawing cats at our practice a long time ago."Mr Dale says that, based on his personal experience, younger vets seem to be more supportive of a ban, especially as more recent research appears to provide evidence against declawing. Mr Birdsall grew up in the US with pet cats that were declawed - but says that after living in the UK, he has discovered alternatives to declawing, such as trimming their claws. "Now I\'m much more uncomfortable with the procedure, and don\'t see the need for it". In the US, "things are generally trending in an anti-declawing direction... although it\'s not a surprise that the one state moving towards banning the practice is a liberal blue state, and cities banning it are typically viewed as left-leaning," he adds."Like many other issues, cat claws could become a politicised cultural issue in the US."\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device\nMedia captionThe squirrels being raised among kittens\nHow can I train my cat not to scratch the furniture?It\'s normal for cats to scratch, as this is how they mark their territory with their scent and with claw marks, says Dr Ellis.It also helps them keep their nails sharp, and stretches their back muscles.However, she says owners can train cats to use scratching posts, although it needs to be at least as long as the cat\'s length so it can stretch against it and drag its claws down.Different cats have different preferences for the type of material, and whether the post is horizontal or vertical, she adds. "We also need to think about location - cats need the posts at certain places, often prominent ones, because that\'s where they mark their territory."Certain products include pheromones that attract cats, Prof Gunn-Moore adds, so she often uses that to train cats to use scratching posts.\nRelated TopicsNew YorkUnited StatesCats\nShare this story\nAbout\xa0sharing\nEmail\nFacebook\nMessenger\nMessenger\nTwitter\nPinterest\nWhatsApp\nLinkedIn\nMore on this story\nViral cat videos and the man who watches thousands of them\n17 March 2019\nAnimal testing: US closes \'kitten slaughterhouse\' after outcry\n3 April 2019\nClaws out over China cat meat scandal\n30 October 2015\nTop Stories\nEgypt\'s ousted president Morsi dies during trial\nMohammed Morsi, the Islamist leader ousted by the army in 2013, dies after collapsing in a courtroom.\n17 June 2019\nIran to breach enriched uranium limit in 10 days\n17 June 2019\n\'Chaos\' hindered London attack medic response\n17 June 2019\nFeatures\nHow to answer \'What\'s your biggest weakness?\'\nMorsi: A turbulent presidency cut short by the army\nThe family-of-four living off-grid\nKuenssberg: Why are MPs lining up behind Boris Johnson?\nCritics praise \'warm\' Top Gear return\nBoeing and the battle over blame\nWhat does personalised medicine mean for you?\n\'I just got fed up with the sexism.

Whether you plan to trade in your old Android phone for a discount on your new phone, sell it on eBay, give it away to a friend, or drop it off for recycling, you’re going to want to wipe it of all your data first by resetting it to factory conditions. Luckily, that’s pretty easy to do.\nBefore you start, be aware that these instructions are for a Pixel 3 XL running Android 9, but the process for most current Android phones should be pretty much the same. Needless to say, first make sure that all of your data is transferred to your new phone, backed up, or both. Once your old phone has reset, there’s no going back.\nGrid View\nThe “Reset options” screen gives you three choices.\nYou’ll be reminded of that you’re wiping all your data, and removing your accounts from the phone.\nAre you sure this is what you want to do? Absolutely sure?\nGo to Settings\nSelect System > Advanced > Reset options\nYou will be presented with three choices. “Reset Wi-Fi, mobile & Bluetooth” is sometimes useful if you’re having trouble with connectivity. “Reset app preferences” will restore all of your app and notification defaults, among other things. Neither of these will delete the data on your phone. That’s the job of the third choice, “Erase all data (factory reset),” and that’s the one you’re going to select.\nYou’ll get a warning screen reminding you that your data that will be erased, along with all the accounts you’re currently signed into. Select “Reset phone.”\nIf you have a PIN or some other security setup, you’ll be asked to enter it\nYou’ll get another screen asking if you’re sure this is what you want to do. Are you sure? Then hit the “Erase everything” button.\nThat’s it! The process usually takes only two or three minutes. Your phone will reboot and begin with the usual opening questions, such as language, account, network, etc. Once you see those, you’ll know that it’s worked.\nThere are a few things to be aware of. First, if you’ve got a Samsung phone, you’re going to be asked for your Samsung account password before you can reset (provided you’ve created one and added it to the phone).\nIf you’ve got an Android phone that is using an earlier version of the OS (say, before version 8), the reset may, after it reboots, ask for your login. This could be awkward if you’ve already sent the phone to someone else. As a result, if you’ve got an older phone, it’s a good idea to turn off your screen lock (by going to Security > Screen lock and selecting “None”) and deleting your Google account (which you’ll find at Settings > Account > Google) before you start the reset.\nThere is evidence that some data may remain on a phone even after it’s been reset. To be extra careful, you can encrypt the phone before resetting it:\nGo to Settings > Security & location > Advanced > Encryption & credentials and select “Encrypt phone”\nGo back to Settings and start the reset process\nOf course, if you want to be really sure, and you don’t intend to give the phone to anyone, you could always grab a hammer.\nVox Media has affiliate partnerships.

For one thing, the new problems are sort of variants of the much splashier Spectre and Meltdown bugs of early 2018. For another, Intel and the entire industry had time to work together to co-announce these new vulnerabilities alongside the patches for them.\nThe new vulnerabilities are built into Intel hardware and go by various names. ZombieLoad, Fallout, or RIDL are the catchy ones; the more technical name is Microarchitectural Data Sampling (MDS). Before we get into it more, you probably want to know what to do about it.\nHow you should respond to MDS is probably exactly what you expect: update your operating system when it asks you to and also make sure your browser is up to date — either can be a vector for these new attacks. Only devices running on Intel chips are affected (though it’s all of them between 2011 the release of fairly recent chips), so iOS devices and the vast majority of Android devices are safe. And it should also be said that there’s been no reported exploits taking advantage of these vulnerabilities in the wild.\nHere are the MDS information pages from a bunch of big software vendors, all of whom have already provided patches or will do so in the very near future:\nApple\nMicrosoft\nGoogle\nAmazon\nRed Hat\nUpdate your software. It’s a simple fix, until — maybe — it isn’t.\nThere’s a complicated and potentially painful decision in store for people who fit a particular profile. Specifically, if you think you’re more likely to be the target of a hack than usual and if you need to be able to push your processor to do computationally intensive things, you will have to make a choice between a higher level of security or a performance hit.\nOn a very basic level, MDS takes advantage of an advanced processor feature called “speculative execution,” just like Spectre and Meltdown did. If you want a detailed and readable breakdown of how it works, Andy Greenberg at Wired has you covered. The important part for a layperson to understand is that because MDS uses a different methodology than those earlier vulnerabilities, it requires different protections.\nSpecifically, there’s a feature on Intel processors called “hyper-threading” that allows the processor to do several things at once. Alongside software patches, fully protecting yourself against MDS means turning that off — and for some users that will result in a significant performance hit.\nThe trade-off here is one that’s familiar to anybody who works in computer security: perfect security is impossible, instead it’s all about assessing your risk and the threat level. Deciding whether it’s worth the performance hit to turn off hyper-threading is complicated — and so different companies are making different decisions.\nIntel, as you might expect, has downplayed the performance hit — though even its testing shows a slowdown as big as 9 percent for consumer products and 19 percent on servers. Choosing to just apply that big a hit across the board is not something tech companies are eager to do, so they’ve all taken different approaches.\nApple chose to leave hyper-threading on by default. Apple says that “customers with computers at heightened risk or who run untrusted software on their Mac” should turn it off — but that the hit to performance could be as much as 40 percent.\nMicrosoft is a little fuzzier in its language about hyper-threading, but says it has “seen some performance impact” and so “in some cases, mitigations are not enabled by default to allow users and administrators to evaluate the performance impact and risk exposure before deciding to enable the mitigations.”\nApple provides instructions on how to disable hyper-threading, while Microsoft has a much more complicated hardware ecosystem and so has a much more complicated guide about how to do it.\nGoogle made a different choice with Chrome OS: it’s turning off hyper-threading by default. For the vast majority of tasks users do on a Chromebook, hyper-threading doesn’t really apply. For those who need it, there’s a way to turn it back on.\nThree cases, three different approaches. But the thing they all have in common is that these companies are making a decision I’m sure none of them really enjoy. They’re choosing a security default and then telling users they’re on their own to decide whether it’s a good idea to change it.\nAre the people who actually need to think about turning hyper-threading on or off really equipped to make an informed decision about these security trade-offs? I tend to doubt it. But all of these companies rightly felt the performance hit was big enough that they shouldn’t take that decision away from consumers.\nIt’s not a fun situation — nor will it get better anytime soon. The reason Spectre and Meltdown were such big deals is they revealed an entirely new method for compromising Intel hardware. That method can be applied in lots of different ways, and MDS is not likely to be the last one.\nThere is good news in all of this: the coordinated disclosure of MDS is a very good sign that security researchers, Intel, and the major players in the tech community are all working together to mitigate these risks. And because this is a flaw in Intel hardware, there’s no permanent fix until users buy new chips without the problem.\nUntil then, there’s going to be more cycles of new vulnerabilities and fixes, each likely to put the same hard choices in front of both tech companies and users. ZDNet pointed me to a post by Greg Kroah-Hartman, the maintainer for the stable branch of Linux kernel. He said it best: “As I said before just over a year ago, Intel once again owes a bunch of people a lot of drinks for fixing their hardware bugs, in our software.”\nCorrection, 10:20am ET 5/17: the original version of this story said all Intel chips since 2011 were vulnerable to MDS at a hardware level. Intel notes that “Microarchitectural Data Sampling (MDS) is already addressed at the hardware level in many of our recent 8th and 9th Generation Intel Core processors, as well as the 2nd Generation Intel Xeon Scalable processor family.” We regret the error and have changed the story above.\nNext Up In\nTech\nGood Deals\nYou can still save $200 on a Samsung Galaxy S10E\nNew deals, plus a few Father’s Day offers that are still active\nGoogle’s loud Home Max speaker is $40 off for Verge readers\nA handful of exclusive deals for you\nThe Google Pixel 3 and 3 XL are $300 off at B&H Photo\nThe sale price is limited to 64GB, ‘not pink’ models\nHollow Knight for $7.50 on the Switch is E3 2019’s best deal\nPlay this game\nAdding a 512GB microSD card to your Nintendo Switch is cheaper than ever\nStarting at $80.99, today only\nMore in Good Deals\nVerge3.0_Logomark_Color_1\nSign up for the\nnewsletter\nCommand Line\nCommand Line delivers daily updates from the near-future.\nemail address...\nSubscribe\nBy signing up, you agree to our Privacy Policy and European users agree to the data transfer policy.\nThis Article has a component height of 25.

Now, that project has been shut down, according to its creators.\nDrip’s unnamed successor project was designed to provide “financial stability and transparency to independent artists.” It came out of conversations from Kickstarter founder Perry Chen and Baio, Kickstarter’s former CTO, with the intention of migrating Drip creators over to it before shutting it down later this year. Kickstarter provided seed funding for the new platform, and Baio and McMillan had brought on people to develop and run the company, but explained that while the concept was a good idea, they “couldn’t find a way to make the business viable.”\nThe issue appears to have come down to how to generate revenue in a stable and reliable way. The pair say that they explored a number of options: “voluntary subscriptions from users, premium features, increased fees,” but kept finding that “the resources required to support a high number of lower-volume creators always outpaced our revenue.”\n“We were intent on running a sustainable and independent business. Even if we went the traditional route and raised venture capital, it didn’t appear likely to survive once that funding ran out. We were building this for the community we care about, and many of the artists and creators in our community are already financially insecure and vulnerable. The idea of launching something with so much uncertainty and risk felt irresponsible and unfair.”\nBaio and McMillan noted that they ended up shutting the project down last month, and will be returning the remaining seed funding to Kickstarter. Drip’s shutdown appears to still be on track to happen: they say that they’re going to help the creators remaining on the platform migrate to others.\nIt’s a bit of a shame, because their description of what they were planning looks to be particularly appealing: a subscription platform with a focus on new and marginalized artists,\nhuman-curated discovery and recommendations, and community moderation tools.\nUpdated June 15th, 3:40PM ET: Updated to clarify that Kickstarter only provided funding for the project: it was uninvolved in the development of the platform.\nNext Up In\nTech\nGood Deals\nYou can still save $200 on a Samsung Galaxy S10E\nNew deals, plus a few Father’s Day offers that are still active\nGoogle’s loud Home Max speaker is $40 off for Verge readers\nA handful of exclusive deals for you\nMore in Good Deals\nVerge3.0_Logomark_Color_1\nSign up for the\nnewsletter\nCommand Line\nCommand Line delivers daily updates from the near-future.\nemail address...\nSubscribe\nBy signing up, you agree to our Privacy Policy and European users agree to the data transfer policy.\nThis Article has a component height of 8.

  'Twitter’s updated T&Cs look clearer — yet it still can’t say no to Nazis – TechCrunch\nTwitter’s updated T&Cs look clearer — yet it still can’t say no to Nazis\nNatasha Lomas\n@riptari\n/\n2 weeks\nTwitter\nhas taken a pair of shears to its user rules, shaving almost 2,000 words off of its T&Cs — with the stated aim of making it clearer for users what is not acceptable behaviour on its platform.\nIt says the rules have shrunk from 2,500 words to just 600 — with each of the reworded rules now encapsulated within a pithy tweet length (280 characters or less).\nThough each tweet-length rule is still followed by plenty of supplementary detail — where Twitter explains the rationale behind it and provides examples of what not to do, and details of potential consequences. So the full rule-book is still way over 2,500 words.\n“Everyone who uses Twitter should be able to easily understand what is and is not allowed on the service,” writes Twitter’s Del Harvey, VP of trust and safety, in a blog post announcing the changes. “As part of our continued push towards more transparency across every aspect of Twitter, we’re working to make sure every rule has its own help page with more detailed information and relevant resources, with abuse and harassment, hateful conduct, suicide or self-harm, and copyright being next on our list to update. Our focus remains on keeping everyone safe and supporting a healthier public conversation on Twitter.”\nThe newly reworded rules can be found at: twitter.com/rules\nWe’ve listed the tweet-sized rules below, without any of their qualifying clutter:\nYou may not threaten violence against an individual or a group of people. We also prohibit the glorification of violence.\nYou may not threaten or promote terrorism or violent extremism.\nWe have zero tolerance for child sexual exploitation on Twitter.\nYou may not engage in the targeted harassment of someone, or incite other people to do so. This includes wishing or hoping that someone experiences physical harm.\nYou may not promote violence against, threaten, or harass other people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or serious disease.\nYou may not promote or encourage suicide or self-harm.\nYou may not post media that is excessively gory or share violent or adult content within live video or in profile or header images. Media depicting sexual violence and/or assault is also not permitted.\nYou may not use our service for any unlawful purpose or in furtherance of illegal activities. This includes selling, buying, or facilitating transactions in illegal goods or services, as well as certain types of regulated goods or services.\nYou may not publish or post other people’s private information (such as home phone number and address) without their express authorization and permission. We also prohibit threatening to expose private information or incentivizing others to do so.\nYou may not post or share intimate photos or videos of someone that were produced or distributed without their consent.\nYou may not use Twitter’s services in a manner intended to artificially amplify or suppress information or engage in behavior that manipulates or disrupts people’s experience on Twitter.\nYou may not use Twitter’s services for the purpose of manipulating or interfering in elections. This includes posting or sharing content that may suppress voter turnout or mislead people about when, where, or how to vote.\nYou may not impersonate individuals, groups, or organizations in a manner that is intended to or does mislead, confuse, or deceive others.\nYou may not violate others’ intellectual property rights, including copyright and trademark.\nNotably the rules make no mention of fascist ideologies being unwelcome on Twitter’s platform. Although a logical person might be forgiven for thinking such hateful stuff would naturally be prohibited — based on the core usage principles Twitter is stating here (such as a ban on threatening and/or promoting violence against groups of people including on the basis of their race, ethnicity and so on).\nBut for Twitter nazi-ism remains, uh, ‘complicated’.\nThe company recently told Vice it’s working with researchers to consider whether or not it should ban Nazis. Which suggests its new ‘pithier’ rules are missing a few qualifying asterisks.\nHere, we fixed one:\nYou may not threaten violence against an individual or a group of people*. We also prohibit the glorification of violence**. *unless you’re a Nazi **white supremacists totally get a pass while we mull the commercial implications of actually banning racist hate\nAnother abuse vector that continues to look like a blindspot in Twitter’s rule-book is sex.\nWhile the company does include both ‘gender’ and ‘gender identity’ among the many categories it stipulates that users must not direct harassment, at or promote violence against, it does not offer the same shield based on a user’s sex. Which appears to have resulted in instances where Twitter has deemed tweets containing violent misogyny to not be in violation of its rules.\nLast month a Twitter UK public policy rep told the parliamentary human rights committee, which had raised the issue of the violent sexist tweets, that it believed the inclusion of gender should be enough to protect against instances of violent misogyny, despite having demonstrably failed to do so in the selection of tweets the committee put to it.\nWe’ve asked Twitter about its continued decision not to prohibit harassment and threats of violence against users based on their sex, as well as its ongoing failure to ban Nazis and will update this report with any response. Update: A Twitter spokeswoman has now sent us this statement:\nThe Twitter Rules exist to help ensure everyone feels safe expressing their beliefs and we strive to enforce them with uniform consistency. Our Hateful Conduct Policy does not allow people to promote violence against or directly attack or threaten other people on the basis of certain protected categories such as sexual orientation, gender and gender identity among others. Meanwhile our Violent Extremism policy expressly states that a user may not make specific threats of violence or wish for the serious physical harm, death, or disease of an individual or group of people. This includes – but is not limited to threatening or promoting terrorism.\nIn addition to editing down the wording of its rules, Twitter says it has thematically organized them under three new categories — safety, privacy, and authenticity — to make it easier for users to find what they’re looking for.\nThough it’s not quite as at-a-glance clear as that on the rules page — which also includes a general preamble; a note on wider content boundaries; a section dealing with spam and security; and an addendum on content visibility restrictions that Twitter may apply in cases where it suspects an account of abuses and is investigating.\nBut, as ever, algorithmically driven platforms are anything but simple.\nHideously wordy T&Cs have of course been a tech staple for years so it’s good to see Twitter paying greater attention to the acceptable conduct signals it gives users — and at least trying to boil down a clearer essence of what isn’t acceptable behavior, albeit tardily.\nBut, equally, refreshed wording of what’s unacceptable makes it plainer that Twitter retains stubborn blind-spots that allow its platform to be a conduct for targeted racial hatred.\nPerhaps these blindspots are commercially motivated, in the case of far right ideologies. Or perhaps Twitter’s leadership is still so drunk on its own philosophical koolaid it really has fuzzed the lines between fascism and, er, humanity.\nIf that’s the case, no pithily written rules will save Twitter from itself.\nDon’t forget, this is a company that has been promising to get a handle on its abuse problem for years. Including — just last year — making a grand stance about wanting to champion ‘conversational health‘.\nYet it still can’t screw its courage to the sticking place and say no Nazis.\nTwitter’s multi-year struggles to respond to baked in hate might be farcical at this point — if the human impacts of amplifying racial and ethnic hatred weren’t a tragedy for all concerned.\nAnd had it found a moral compass when it was first being warned about the rising tide of amplified abuse, it’s entirely possible one of its most high profile users might not be a geopolitical mega-bully known to retweet fascist propaganda.\nChew on that, Jack.',
  'China says it will ‘soon grant’ 5G licenses for commercial use – TechCrunch\nChina says it will ‘soon grant’ 5G licenses for commercial use\nRita Liao\n2 weeks\nThere’s a widely accepted method to interpret China’s official announcements: the shorter the news, the heavier it is. Today, in one concise sentence, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, China’s telecom regulator, announced that it will “soon grant 5G licenses for commercial use.”\nThat’s according to the Communist Party newspaper People’s Daily. TechCrunch reported four months ago that China planned to “fast-track” the commercial use of the next-gen networking technology at a time when Huawei, the champion of the country’s 5G development, faces mounting pressure in the west as the U.S. lobbies its allies not to use Huawei technologies.\nChina continues 5G push despite economic slowdown and Huawei setbacks\nThe Chinese firm is selling a majority stake of its undersea cable division weeks after the Trump administration blocked it from doing businesses with American companies.\nThe Chinese firm manages to find allies in other parts of the world. Just last week, it launched a 5G lab in South Korea but decided to keep the event “low-key,” Reuters reported, notably because the Asian country is a security ally of the U.S.\nThe acceleration of 5G licensing in China will also be a potential boost to the domestic economy, as it will “drum up demand with upgraded technology experiences across devices, automotive and manufacturing leveraging 5G technology,” Neil Shah,\nresearch director at Counterpoint Research, told TechCrunch in a previous interview.\n5G technologies are expected to generate 6.3 trillion yuan ($947 billion) worth of economic output and 8 million jobs for China by 2030, according to a white paper released by\xa0the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology.',
  'Why identity startup Auth0’s founder still codes: It makes him a better boss – TechCrunch\nWhy identity startup Auth0’s founder still codes: It makes him a better boss\nZack Whittaker\n@zackwhittaker\n/\n2 weeks\nIf you ask Eugenio Pace to describe himself, “engineer” would be fairly high on the list.\n“Being a CEO is pretty busy,” he told TechCrunch in a call last week. “But I’m an engineer in my heart — I am a problem solver,” he said.\nPace, an Argentinan immigrant to the U.S., founded identity management company Auth0\nin 2013 after more than a decade at Microsoft. Auth0, pronounced “auth-zero,” has been described as like Stripe for payments or Twilio for messaging. App developers can add a few lines of code and it immediately gives their users access to the company’s identity management service.\nThat means the user can securely log in to the app without building a homebrew username and password system that’s invariably going to break. Any enterprise paying for Auth0 can also use its service to securely logon to the company’s internal network.\n“Nobody cares about authentication, but everybody needs it,” he said.\nPace said Auth0 works to answer two simple questions. “Who are you, and what can you do?” he said.\n“Those two questions are the same regardless of the device, the app, or whether if I’m an employee of somebody or if I am an individual using an app, or if I am using a device where there’s no human attached to it,” he said.\nWhoever the users are, the app needs to know if the person using the app or service is allowed to, and what level of access or functionality they can get. “Can you transfer these funds?,” he said. “Can you approve these expense reports? Can you open the door of my house?” he explained.\nPace left Microsoft in 2012 and founded Auth0 during the emergence of Azure, which transformed Microsoft from a software giant into a cloud company. It was at Microsoft where he found identity management was one of the biggest headaches for developers moving their apps to the cloud. He wrote book after book, and edition after edition. “I felt like I could keep writing books about the problem — or I can just solve the problem,” he said.\nSo he did.\nInstead of teaching developers how to become experts in identity management, he wanted to give them the tools to employ a sign-on solution without ever having to read a book.',
  'To detect fake news, this AI first learned to write it – TechCrunch\nTo detect fake news, this AI first learned to write it\n"To know your enemy, you must become your enemy."\nDevin Coldewey\n@techcrunch\n/\n1 week\nOne of the biggest problems in media today is so-called “fake news,” which is so highly pernicious in part because it superficially resembles the real thing. AI tools promise to help identify it, but in order for it to do so, researchers have found that the best way is for that AI to learn to create fake news itself — a double-edged sword, though perhaps not as dangerous as it sounds.\nGrover is a new system created by the University of Washington\nand Allen Institute for AI (AI2) computer scientists that is extremely adept at writing convincing fake news on myriad topics and as many styles — and as a direct consequence is also no slouch at spotting it. The paper describing the model is available here.\nThe idea of a fake news generator isn’t new — in fact, OpenAI made a splash recently by announcing that its own text-generating AI was too dangerous to release publicly. But Grover’s creators believe we’ll only get better at fighting generated fake news by putting the tools to create it out there to be studied.\nOpenAI built a text generator so good, it’s considered too dangerous to release\n“These models are not capable, we think right now, of inflicting serious harm. Maybe in a few years they will be, but not yet,” the lead on the project, Rowan Zellers, told me. “I don’t think it’s too dangerous to release — really, we need to release it, specifically to researchers who are studying this problem, so we can build better defenses. We need all these communities, security, machine learning, natural language processing, to talk to each other — we can’t just hide the model, or delete it and pretend it never happened.”\nTherefore and to that end, you can try Grover yourself right here. (Though you might want to read the rest of this article first so you know what’s going on.)\nVoracious reader\nThe AI was created by having it ingest an enormous corpus of real news articles, a dataset called RealNews that is being introduced alongside Grover. The 120-gigabyte library contains articles from the end of 2016 through March of this year, from the top 5,000 publications tracked by Google News.\nBy studying the style and content of millions of real news articles, Grover builds a complex model of how certain phrases or styles are used, what topics and features follow one another in an article, how they’re associated with different outlets, ideas, and so on.\nThis is done using an “adversarial” system, wherein one aspect of the model generates content and another rates how convincing it is — if it doesn’t meet a threshold, the generator tries again, and eventually it learns what is convincing and what isn’t. Adversarial setups are a powerful force in AI research right now, often being used to create photorealistic imagery from scratch.\nMona Lisa frown: Machine learning brings old paintings and photos to life\nIt isn’t just spitting out random articles, either. Grover is highly parameterized, meaning its output is highly dependent on input. So if you tell it to create a fake article about a study linking vaccines and autism spectrum disorders, you are also free to specify that the article should seem as if it appeared on CNN, Fox News, or even TechCrunch.\nI generated a few articles, which I’ve pasted at the bottom of this one, but here’s the first bit of an example:\nSerial entrepreneur Dennis Mangler raises 6M to create blockchain-based drone delivery\nMay 29, 2019 – Devin Coldewarg\nDrone delivery — not so new, and that raises a host of questions: How reliable is the technology? Will service and interference issues flare up?\nDrone technology is changing a lot, but its most obvious use — package delivery — has never been perfected on a large scale, much less by a third party. But perhaps that is about to change.\nSerial entrepreneur Dennis Mangler has amassed an impressive — by the cybernetic standards of this short-lived and crazy industry — constellation of companies ranging from a top-tier Korean VC to a wholly owned subsidiary of Amazon, ranging from a functional drone repair shop to a developer of commercial drone fleets.\nBut while his last company (Amazon’s Prime Air) folded, he has decided to try his hand at delivery by drone again with Tripperell, a San Francisco-based venture that makes sense of the cryptocurrency token space to create a bridge from blockchain to delivery.\nThe system they’re building is sound — as described in a new Medium post, it will first use Yaman Yasmine’s current simple crowdsourced drone repair platform, SAA, to create a drone organization that taps into a mix of overseas networks and domestic industry.\nFrom there the founders will form Tripperell, with commercialized drones running on their own smart contracts to make deliveries.\nNot bad considering it only took about ten seconds to appear after I gave it the date, domain, my name (ish), and the headline. (I’d probably tweak that lede, but if you think about it, it does sort of make sense.)\nNote that it doesn’t actually know who I am, or what TechCrunch is. But it associates certain data with other data. For instance, one example the team offered was an editorial “in the style of,” to co-opt cover bands’ lingo, Paul Krugman’s New York Times editorials.\nI don’t think it’s too dangerous to release — really, we need to release it.\n”\nThere’s nothing hard coded — we haven’t told the model who Paul Krugman is. But it learns from reading a lot,” Zellers told me. The system is just trying to make sure that the generated article is sufficiently like the other data it associates with that domain and author. “And it’s going to learn things like, ‘Paul Krugman’ tends to talk about ‘economics,’ without us telling it that he’s an economist.”\nIt’s hard to say how much it will attempt to affect a given author’s style — that may or may not be something it “noticed,” and AI models are notoriously opaque to analysis. Its style aping goes beyond the author; it even went so far as creating the inter-paragraph “Read more” links in a “Fox News” article I generated.\nBut this facility in creating articles rests on the ability to tell when an article is not convincing — that’s the “discriminator” that evaluates whether the output of the “generator” is any good. So what happens if you feed the discriminator other stuff? Turns out it’s better than any other AI system right now, at least within the limits of the tasks they tested it on, at determining what’s fake and what’s real.\nFabula AI is using social spread to spot ‘fake news’\nNatural language limitations\nNaturally Grover is best at detecting its own fake articles, since in a way the agent knows its own processes. But it can also detect those made by other models, such as OpenAI’s GPT2, with high accuracy. This is because current text-generation systems share certain weaknesses, and with a few examples those weaknesses become even more obvious to the discriminator.\n“These models have to make one of two bad choices. The first bad option is you just trust the model,” Zeller said. In this case, you get a sort of error-compounding issue where a single bad choice, which is inevitable given the number of choices it has to make, leads to another bad one, and another, and so on; “Without supervision they often just go off the rails.”\n“The other choice is to play it a bit safer,” Zellers explained, citing OpenAI’s decision to have the generator create dozens of options and pick the most likely one. This conservative approach avoids unlikely word combinations or phrases — but as Zellers points out, “human speech is a mix of high probability and low probability words. If I knew what you were going to tell me, you wouldn’t be speaking. So there have to be some things that are hard to anticipate.”\nThese and other habits in text generation algorithms make it possible for Grover to identify generated articles with 92 percent accuracy.\nAnd no, you’re very clever, but you can’t just take the ones it doesn’t detect and sort of breed them together to make more convincing ones. As it turns out, this type of strategy doesn’t actually help a lot — the resulting “super-algorithms” still stumble in similar ways.\nSelf-extinguishing danger\nOn the face of it, Grover seems like a pretty dangerous tool. With a bit of tweaking the articles it created for me could easily pass the smell test of a casual reader unfamiliar with the topic. So why is the team releasing it and the dataset it’s based on?\nThe more articles we have from an adversary, the easier it is to detect that adversary.\nFirst of all it’s not just going to be an app you download — “We want researchers to easily be able to use the model, but we’re not making it completely public,” Zellers clarified. But even so, the likelihood of it being used for evil is counterintuitively low.\n“If you just wanted to write ten take news articles, you could just write them yourself,” he points out — and indeed, it’s hard to imagine some mastermind going to all this trouble just to generate a handful. “But if you want to write a hundred thousand, you could use our tool — but the more articles we have from an adversary, the easier it is to detect that adversary.” So it would be a self-defeating plot resulting in a sort of “known fake news” that’s easy to flag.\nThat assumes, however, that there’s a method for applying algorithms like Grover’s to news at large, or that individuals are motivated to question or verify articles they read in the first place. Unfortunately that’s not anywhere near the case.\n“This is a totally non machine learning related question,” Zellers admitted. “How do we make this useful for people? How do we make it so when people read news online, they can check if it’s fake, and want to?”\nNo AI can generate a good answer to that prompt. Here’s hoping we humans are up to the task.\nAppendix\nI generated several articles to study, and some were better than others. I didn’t save all of them, but I’ve put a few below for anyone curious to see what Grover’s output looks like without going and generating their own. The results are entertaining and far from nonsense, though anyone who reads closely at all would see some red flags. I’ve only slightly formatted for readability and haven’t changed any words.\nThe first is a redo of the one I quoted above, with a slightly tweaked headline (that’s misinterpreted in an unexpected yet logical way):\nSerial founder Dennis Mangler raises 6M to create blockchain-based drone delivery\nMay 30, 2019 – Devin Coldewey, techcrunch.com\nDennis Mangler of Serial, one of the first open source blockchain-based systems to launch and now a key part of the Ethereum ecosystem, has raised a couple of million dollars in venture funding in order to bring drones and cryptocurrencies together.\nArmed with $1.4 million of seed funding, they’re now offering new features for their system to seed investors, including a marketplace for goods sold using the platform. In some ways this could be analogous to the early days of Bitcoin — it had a primary market in petabytes of processing power, and all it took to mine something was an individual machine with the right electricity and gigabytes of RAM. Drones could eventually deliver that stuff just as easily, but they’d also need to run some kind of distributed ledger.\n“There’s a tremendous opportunity for companies to seamlessly connect the logistics side of the industry and the blockchain side of the industry,” Mangler told me. “A lot of companies are already already doing it. But we want to supercharge their efforts and help them change how they operate.”\nIf they can plug the crypto in, where it comes from and why would people care about it as a means of exchanging value or keeping track of it, and what could be done to legitimize or add interest to the platform.\nThe fundraiser is still going — Mangler sent me some emails, asking that I not make too much of it — but the raise has now reached 6 million. You can find information on the project here.\nFirst, take note of the speed with which this started to sprout. You’d figure in this day and age that looking at how much money was being raised, accredited investors and large corporations would surpass crowdsourced funding — but Mangler says not so fast.\n“The coin exchange is going to be enabled in a couple of months,” he told me. “And I believe the push-ups are going to become a new industry before the cryptocurrency market itself is.”\nTo do that, some smart marketplaces are going to have to be created; however, these might have to function with information and transactions distributed far across the network rather than in clusters running the decentralized network. An air-traffic control system would theoretically be in place as well — a little like Microsoft’s Azure, or Facebook’s Open Graph, but an open blockchain-based variant.\nAnd finally, he says the buzz is you should look at Amazon as a model; they invented the space, and just through focus and sharp execution have pretty much changed it. They need a little time to build it out but they’re getting there.\nThis one was done in the style of Fox News. There’s no such person as Dr Nicholas Colvin — I checked. Bobby Scott is indeed a Member of Congress – but in Virginia, not Florida.\nMulti-year study links vaccines to higher incidence of Autism spectrum disorders\nMay 29, 2019 – Sofia Ojeda, foxnews.com\nDr. Nicholas Colvin, lead author on a new multi-year study published by the National Institutes of Health, says as a vaccine advocate, he understands the risks and benefits of vaccines in the United States.\n“At the core of it, it’s about safety. You know, we have options for our children, and parents have choices in making those choices. And vaccines provide, you know, safety for all those kids, all those families,” Dr. Colvin said.\nREAD MORE: Autism experts call California vaccine study ‘shaky science’\nColvin and colleagues looked at all medical records of nearly 3 million kids in the first decade of this century. They found girls tend to be more sensitive to the harmful side effects of vaccines than boys.\n“Specifically in autism, and other neurodevelopmental disorders in kids, our analyses show that there is higher prevalence of autism in kids that have been vaccinated than in kids that haven’t been vaccinated,” he said.\nIn fact, people born around 2000 were more likely to have autism or similar neurodevelopmental disorders than kids born in earlier decades.\n“And then we also found that younger kids in the United States, those born between 2000 and 2011, had a somewhat higher rate of autism — and that higher rate was driven by girls,” Colvin said.\nREAD MORE: Trump endorses FL Rep. Bobby Scott’s position on vaccine bill\nDr. Colvin points out the findings aren’t meant to scare parents from vaccines.\n“I don’t want to scare people. I just want to make sure parents are aware that there is a risk. We don’t think this is a big risk. It is certainly real and is, you know, consistent with other research, but not in a way that I would say is something that’s life-threatening,” Colvin said.\nHe also points out that there is no known cause of autism, which is why he says anyone with suspicion or concern should talk to their doctor.\nThe National Institutes of Health says there is no vaccine for autism at this time. Colvin says that uncertainty has caused some misconceptions and a decrease in vaccine uptake\nLastly, I was interested to see what would happen if I threw a monkey wrench in there:\nFounder Daenarys Targaryen raises 17M Series A round for new AI startup offering “self-driving blockchain”\nMay 29, 2019 – Kenneth Turan, techcrunch.com\nOne thing about “Game of Thrones” is that the characters are an active group of entrepreneurs, all with new enterprises at the ready when the show’s storylines take off. And it looks like the show’s creators, David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, and the team behind live-streaming game streaming app Twitch are thinking about going the same way, if not longer.\nGood behavior indeed. First, the Lannisters get their Hand: Haylie Duff is on board as an executive producer. Today, we learn that Rene Oberyn Martell, one of the “impossible sons” we saw in season six (the name was borrowed from a line in Robert’s Rebellion) has established himself as the new face and voice of a new company called Margaery One.\nWe learn that Margaery is a decentralized data machine; indeed, she’s acting as the network’s self-appointed captain of the board, wielding primary command authority. Through an AI-powered network of blockchain token dubbed REDL (or “red gold”), she controls an operation that enables her team to develop and collect decentralized data in the real world, secure from the needs of tyrannical governments such as that of King Robert.\nIt’s a cool little concept, and part of a litany of “Blockchain”-based product launches the team behind the firm is demonstrating and introducing this week at the inaugural Game of Money. As of this writing, the firm has achieved 27 million REDLs (which are tokens comprised of “real” money in the Bitcoin form), which amount to more than $16 million. This meant that by the end of today’s conference, Omo and his team had raised $17 million for its existence, according to the firm’s CEO, Rene Oberyn Martell.\nAs of today, one of Rene’s institutions, dubbed the Economics Research Centre, has already created value of $3.5 million on the back of crowd-funding. (On each ROSE token, you can purchase a service)\nThe real-world business side is provided by Glitrex Logistics, which Martell co-founded along with Jon Anderson, an engineer, and the firm’s COO, Lucas Pirkis. They have developed a blockchain-based freight logistics platform that allows shippers to specify “valued goods in your portfolio,” and get information along with prices on things like goods with a certain quality, or untraditional goods such as food and pharmaceuticals.\nHow will the firm use ROSE tokens? For starters, the aim is to break down the areas where it can have an effect, including distribution and how goods get to market, and build a community for self-improvement and growth.\nThis echoes comments from Neal Baer, chairman of NBC Entertainment, about the future of distribution. In a recent blog post, he said he hopes that the Internet of Things and artificial intelligence will become integrated to create the new economic system that will follow the loss of “the earnings power of traditional media and entertainment content,” telling readers that the next round of innovation and disruption will be “powered by the Internet of Things.”\nIf so, this has the whiff of the future of entertainment — not just new revenue sources, but realms of competence, naturally distinct from the impact of algorithm-based algorithms. And while it can be argued that entertainment and fashion are separate, the result could be a complex world where characters rise to the occasion based not on the smarts of the writer but of the cast.\nAs noted above, you can create your own fake articles at Grover.',

  'Walmart announces it will fully integrate Jet’s teams, but Jet will remain a standalone brand – TechCrunch\nWalmart announces it will fully integrate Jet’s teams, but Jet will remain a standalone brand\nCatherine Shu\n@catherineshu\n/\n5 days\nThree years after acquiring Jet for $3 billion, Walmart announced today that it is now more fully integrating Jet’s teams into Walmart. Jet\nwill continue to operate as a standalone brand, mainly in large cities.\nJet president Simon Belsham will support the transition through early August. After that, Jet will be managed by Kiernan Shanahan, Walmart\nsenior vice president of food, consumables and health and wellness and the lead of Walmart Ecommerce’s Everyday Living category. Jeff Saunders, Jet’s vice president of operations and tech lead, will lead the integration of Jet into the Everyday Living team.\nIn a blog post announcing the transition, Walmart Ecommerce president and CEO Marc Lore explained that the company decided to fold the rest of Jet’s teams into Walmart because “Across most of the country, we saw we could get a much higher return on our marketing investments with Walmart.com, so we’ve dialed up our marketing spend there. However, in specific large cities where Walmart has few or no stores, Jet has become hyper focused on those urban customers.”\n“While this has made Jet smaller from a sales perspective, it has helped us create a smart portfolio approach where our businesses complement each other,” he added.\nAfter Walmart acquired Jet in 2016, it merged a few of its teams, including supply chain. Combining fulfillment centers and mirroring inventory helped Walmart build its delivery logistics, enabling two-day free shipping and free next-day delivery without a membership fee, making it more competitive with Amazon, which charges a fee for its Prime program.\nJet.com relaunched last year to focus on customers in big cities, like New York, with a product assortment tailored to their shopping preferences and three-hour grocery delivery to compete with Amazon Prime Now. Jet also introduced a concierge shopping service called JetBlack last year as a standalone e-commerce business aimed at busy parents living in cities who don’t have a lot of time to shop in brick and mortar stores or browse online. Last week, JetBlack announced that its customers spend an average of $1,500 per month on purchases, on top of the $50 monthly fee they pay for the service.\nIn his post, Lore wrote “Jet continues to be a very valuable brand to us, and it is playing a specific role in helping Walmart reach urban customers. The focus has largely been on NY so far, and we’re looking at other cities where we might bring together Jet’s expertise and the scale and operating model of Walmart. More to come on that.”',

It\'s been a good journey, a tough journey. On the sides of the journey there are billboards, then with time, two billboards but it\'s all about winning in this sport. "I haven\'t put a foot wrong yet and I am not looking to put a foot wrong on Saturday either."AJ\'s breakthrough and point to proveWilder - who is expected to face Luis Ortiz in his next bout - will not be at \'The Garden\' on Saturday but his manager Shelly Finkel will.There appears little chance of a contest with Joshua in the coming 12 months, meaning both men risk losing their huge payday and unification bout with a defeat before then.But Joshua, who stopped the respected Alexander Povetkin last time out, has previously warned delays will only make him better and feels the preparations for this fight are his best ever, having refined methods after almost 11 years in the sport."I\'ve had 10 years of that feeling of being burnt out by the time I get to the ring," the 2012 Olympic champion said. "Even in the Povetkin fight I was so ill and tired. This camp, I knew I couldn\'t afford that again and again as it shortens the career. So it\'s learning but it\'s taken time. We are finally pulling it together."It\'s time to rebuild that name again. I feel like an underdog and like I want to prove myself."Ruiz gets an Insta scrap\nRuiz, born in California of Mexican heritage, will give away around four inches in height and substantial reach to Joshua.But the 29-year-old, who lost a world-title shot against Joseph Parker in 2016, appeared entirely at ease before countless media in New York and said he pounced on the chance to face Joshua when American Jarrell Miller failed drugs tests to lose his chance at the titles."I was bugging Eddie Hearn on Instagram, saying \'give me the chance, I can do better than the other guys lined up\'," said Ruiz, who has one defeat in 33 fights."He messaged me back and I was telling my partner \'hey babe he messaged back\'. And what do you know, we got the fight on."Part of the fight week narrative is expected to focus on the physique of Ruiz, who weighed 262lbs in his last contest, meaning he will likely be the heaviest opponent Joshua has faced.The pair will both workout before the public in Manhattan on Tuesday, offering media a glimpse of Ruiz\'s condition."I feel amazing, my conditioning is good," he added. "Miller gave me the opportunity but I\'m here now to make history."This is for my Mexican people and kids. I wake up, run, train, all the sweat is for my kids\' futures and it\'s for Mexico, to be the country\'s first heavyweight champion of the world."\'Fearless Ruiz will go all in\' - analysisBBC Sport boxing correspondent Mike Costello: "I thought Anthony Joshua tonight looked like a man made for these occasions. I thought he looked absolutely spot on."Ruiz will be giving away a lot in height and reach and we could sense that stood next to him. It\'s an upward curve but you do get the sense from him he will give it a right go."\nBBC Radio 5 Live analyst Steve Bunce: "Ruiz is fearless, he\'s stepped up. He didn\'t quibble about money. He has absolutely no physical edges whatsoever but he\'s used to that against big heavyweights. Rest assured, Andy Ruiz will deliver heart and guts."\nView Comments\nShare\nthis page\nShare this with\nDigg\nFacebook\nGoogle\nLinkedIn\nReddit\nStumbleUpon\nTwitter\nCopy this link http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/boxing/48430161 Read more about sharing.\nFind out more\nBritish Boxing Board of Control\nRead more on British Boxing Board of Control\nTop Stories\nWatch: Fifa Women\'s World Cup - Nigeria 0-0 France\nLive\nFrom the section Football\nRead more on Watch: Fifa Women\'s World Cup - Nigeria 0-0 France\nWatch: Fifa Women\'s World Cup - South Korea 0-2 Norway\nLive\nFrom the section Football\nRead more on Watch: Fifa Women\'s World Cup - South Korea 0-2 Norway\nGermany thrash SA to top group\n17 Jun\nFrom the section Football\nRead more on Germany thrash SA to top group\nRelated to this story\nBoxing schedule and results 2019\n16 Jun\nFrom the section Boxing\nRead more on Boxing schedule and results 2019\nAlso in Sport\n\'One of the best saves at any Women\'s World Cup ever\'\nRivals on the field, friends off it - fans light up India-Pakistan match\nFive key questions for Chelsea after Sarri exit\nWorld sport: 10 photos we liked this week\nPhotos: Fury goes all Apollo Creed on winning Vegas debut\n\'The goal meant so much\' - a moment of redemption for Thailand after 13-0 thrashing\n\'I was addicted to drugs, now I\'m addicted to running\'\nAre Real Madrid starting a new Galacticos era?\nWhat can cricket do about the rain?\nWatch: Australia condemn Brazil to first group-stage defeat in 24 years\nWoods hoping for 10 more years at the top of golf\nThe lost lionesses - England\'s forgotten teenage football trailblazers\nExplore the BBC\nHeart broken for the #FIRST time Laura Anderson takes a look at the life-changing moments that shape our lives\nGet Inspired\nFind ways to get active\nHow to get involved in just about any sport or activity\nFind a club, activity or sport near you\nBack to top\nBoxing\nResults & Schedule\nCalendar\nChampions List\nBoxing Home\nNews Feeds\nHelp & FAQs\nExplore the BBCHomeNewsSportWeatheriPlayerSoundsCBBCCBeebiesFoodBitesizeArtsTasterLocalTVRadioThree Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCGet Personalised NewslettersCopyright © 2019 BBC.

  'Huawei files motion to challenge sweeping US ban, calling it ‘not normal’ – TechCrunch\nHuawei files motion to challenge sweeping US ban, calling it ‘not normal’\nBrian Heater\n@bheater\n/\n3 weeks\nHuawei this morning began the process of challenging the Trump administration’s sweeping ban. The Chinese hardware giant has filed a motion for summary judgement that calls into question the constitutionality of the section of the National Defense Authorization Act used to halt imports.\nThe company’s chief legal officer cited Huawei’s usual arrays of arguments against the U.S. government. “Politicians in the U.S. are using the strength of an entire nation to come after a private company,” Song Liuping said in a prepared statement. “This is not normal. Almost never seen in history.”\nHuawei, of course, has long been scrutinized by the U.S. over alleged ties to the Chinese government tied to security concerns with its mobile devices and networking equipment, including 5G infrastructure. The company has also been dinged for alleged violations of U.S. sanctions with countries like Iran.\nThe issues between parties have heated up dramatically in recent months, leading to a ban on U.S. companies doing business with Huawei. While the smartphone maker has suggested that it has backup plans in the works to become self-sufficient, the inability to do business with software and components companies like Google and ARM could be insurmountable.\nSong’s statement struck some dystopian overtones, suggesting that the recent addition of the company to the U.S. Commerce Department’s Entity List “sets a dangerous precedent,” issuing an ominous warning to fellow companies. “The U.S. government has provided no evidence to show that Huawei is a security threat. There is no gun, no smoke. Only speculation,” he added.\nA hearing for the motion is scheduled for September 19.',
  'Netflix says it would ‘rethink’ filming in Georgia if abortion law takes effect – TechCrunch\nNetflix says it would ‘rethink’ filming in Georgia if abortion law takes effect\nAnthony Ha\n@anthonyha\n/\n3 weeks\nNetflix’s\nchief content officer Ted Sarandos said the streaming service (which is spending billions of dollars on an ever-growing catalog of original content) will “rethink [its] whole investment in Georgia” if a recently signed abortion law goes into effect.\nSarandos’ statement was first published in Variety.\xa0The industry publication said it reached out to the major studios for comment on the issue, and it contrasted his position with a lack of response from The Walt Disney Company, WarnerMedia, Sony Pictures Entertainment, NBCUniversal, Viacom, Fox and Amazon Studios.\n“We have many women working on productions in Georgia, whose rights, along with millions of others, will be severely restricted by this law,” Sarandos said. “It’s why we will work with the ACLU and others to fight it in court. Given the legislation has not yet been implemented, we’ll continue to film there, while also supporting partners and artists who choose not to. Should it ever come into effect, we’d rethink our entire investment in Georgia.”\nThis comes as the stars of two Netflix shows — Jason Bateman of “Ozark” and Alyssa Milano of “Insatiable” — have said they would stop filming in the state if the law takes effect.\nOther filmmakers have taken the route of Ron Howard and Brian Grazer, who said they’ll proceed with plans to film their Netflix movie “Hillbilly Elegy” in Georgia while making a donation to the ACLU to fight the anti-abortion legislation. (Howard and Grazer also said they will boycott the state if the law takes effect.)\nThe law in question, which was signed by Georgia Governor Brian Kemp on May 7, prohibits abortion after the detection of a fetal heartbeat — something that usually happens after six weeks of pregnancy. It’s widely seen as\xa0part of a larger effort aimed at getting the Supreme Court to overturn or weaken the abortion protections established in Roe v. Wade.\nThanks to state tax incentives, Georgia has become a hub for film and TV, with productions bringing the state an estimated $2.7 billion in revenue in 2017.\nUpdate: In an interview with Reuters, Disney CEO Bob Iger was asked whether the company (which shot “Black Panther,” “Avengers: Endgame” and other big productions in Georgia) would continue filming in the state if the law took effect.\n“I rather doubt we will,” Iger replied. “I think many people who work for us will not want to work there, and we will have to heed their wishes in that regard. Right now we are watching it very carefully.”',
  'Review: The 2019 Bentley Continental GT is beautiful, excessive and totally worth it – TechCrunch\nReview: The 2019 Bentley Continental GT is beautiful, excessive and totally worth it\nSo this is how the other half lives\nMatt Burns\n@mjburnsy\n/\n2 weeks\nThe Bentley Continental GT is iconic. The vehicle has long stood for excess and opulence, and I knew that going in. I expected the Continental GT to be over-engineered and capable of high-speed thrills. And it is, but there’s more.\nThe tester I’m driving costs $279,000. Of course it’s beautiful and fast and dripping with technology. It’s a Bentley. Inside and out, at high speed or low speed, the latest Continental GT exceeded all my expectations.\nThe machine glides over the road, powered by a mechanical symphony performing under the hood. The W12 engine is a dying breed, and it’s a shame. It’s stunning in its performance. This is a 200 mph vehicle, but I didn’t hit those speeds. What surprised me the most is that I didn’t need to go fast. The new Continental GT is thrilling in a way that doesn’t require speed. It’s like a great set of speakers or exclusive liquor. Quality over quantity, and in this mechanical form, the quality is stunning.\n[gallery ids="1837531,1837540,1837539,1837544,1837543,1837542,1837533,1837538,1837537,1837536,1837535,1837541"]\nReview\nBentley debuted the Continental GT in 2003 and has retained a familiar form over the years. Its mission has remained constant: To be the very best grand touring car available. It has held that crown on and off since 2003 as other cars entered the game. But with this latest revision, the crown has returned to Bentley. This is an astounding vehicle to take on a road trip. It’s like a private jet on the highway.\nUnder the long hood sits a massive W12 engine with twin turbos. The setup results in over 620 HP and 664-foot pounds of torque. And it knows how to translate those numbers to the pavement. The engine pounds not like a stack of Marshall amps at a Motorhead concert, but like a symphony playing Beethoven’s 5th with intensity.\nThe Bentley Continental GT performance is where it stands apart.\nIt glides as speeds reach illegal levels. There’s no drama from the transmission or argument from the engine. When the accelerator drops to the floor, a gateway opens in front of the Bentley, allowing it to transcend space and time as it exceeds posted speed limits.\nThe Bentley Continental GT lays out its power with the precision of an electric vehicle but the intensity of a street racer. The power delivery is unreal. Under normal driving modes, the transmission is hardly noticeable, and under strain of chasing a quarter mile, the shifts are barely noticeable as it arm wrestles the massive W12.\nDriving the Bentley Continental GT is an exercise in restraint. At times, say, when coming out of a gnarly curve, you feel the need to slam the pedal to the floor and launch the car off the apex. But that would land you in jail. This is a car that could live its best life on a track, but it doesn’t need the track to be happy. Even driving the Continental GT to the golf course or office park is nearly a thrill.\nThe GT is just excellent. It inspires confidence and regal intrigue that’s often missing in many of its contemporaries.\nEntering the latest Continental is like sinking behind the controls of a fantasy rocket ship. Brushed metal adorns the center stack and handcrafted wood and leather wrap the cabin. Adorable metal pulls control the vents, and machined knobs perform various functions.\nThe leather is soft and the metal real. It’s the little things, too. The lume on the analog clock is fantastic and the wood grain matches throughout. The seats feature a lovely diamond pattern with multiple layers of embroidered detail. Don’t want to look at an LCD screen? Hit a button and it rotates away, revealing a set of three analog gauges in its place.\nHowever, throughout the Continental GT, there are odd choices of material. Example: The gear shift is plastic and creaks like a well-used toy. It’s an odd choice for a substantial touchpoint. It feels cheap in comparison to gear shifters in other vehicles. BMW, for instance, is using manufactured crystal in its new large SUV, and it conveys a sense of stoutness missing in the Bentley.\nOther plastic bits feel out of place. When sitting down, a bar extends from behind the seats, pushing the seatbelt within reach of the driver. It’s flimsy plastic. The handle on the outside feels loose. Even the key fob is underwhelming; I think the fob for my F-150 is more substantial.\nI’m nitpicking, but the Bentley Continental GT costs north of $279,000.\nThe controls are familiar. The Bentley uses a lot of switch plates and instruments from Audi’s parts bin, though in the Bentley, they’re chrome. The Audi theme continues to the digital instrument cluster where it shares the same design as the one found in most Audis. Expect a similar experience throughout. This isn’t a bad thing. Audi has one of the best interfaces available throughout the industry.\nThe 2019 Bentley Continental GT is unforgettable. It’s a beautiful combination of obscene power and luxury materials.\nI took delivery of this tester on the eve of a long weekend and spent as much time in it as I could. It’s more comfortable than my house. The seats are supple and supportive. The dash is impressive with its woodwork and analog dials. The power is intoxicating.\nCars like the Continental GT will likely continue to exist after electric vehicles become the norm. At least until the Earth runs out of oil. They have to. Cars like this will always be a luxury item. They have a soul that is missing from electric vehicles. There’s nothing like putting your foot down on a Bentley W12 and feeling the world come alive around you.',
  'Google’s Cloud outage is resolved, but it reveals the holes in cloud computing’s atmosphere – TechCrunch\nGoogle’s Cloud outage is resolved, but it reveals the holes in cloud computing’s atmosphere\nJonathan Shieber\n@jshieber\n/\n2 weeks\nFive hours after Google\npublicly announced that it was working to resolve an outage in its Cloud computing network that had taken out a large chunk of Google services as well as Shopify,\nSnap,\nDiscord and other popular apps, the problem seems to be resolved.\nThe outage hit everything from the ability to control the temperature in people’s homes and apartments through Google’s Nest to shopping on any service powered by Shopify, to Snapchat and Discord’s\nsocial networks.\n“The network congestion issue in eastern USA, affecting Google Cloud, G Suite, and YouTube has been resolved for all affected users as of 4:00pm US/Pacific,” the company said in a statement.\n“We will conduct an internal investigation of this issue and make appropriate improvements to our systems to help prevent or minimize future recurrence. We will provide a detailed report of this incident once we have completed our internal investigation. This detailed report will contain information regarding SLA credits.”\nEven though the networking issue has been resolved, the fact that problems with Google’s cloud services could cause outages for several of the world’s most popular applications underscores how thin cloud coverage can be for modern computing architectures.\nMost companies have put their entire backend in the hands of one company and while the benefits outweigh the risks most of the time, it’s worthwhile to at least think about contingency planning.\nModern cloud architectures have slashed the cost of creating new technology businesses, but it also means that companies are typically dependent on one service for their ability to operate.\nAs the world becomes more networked (especially as internet-enabled devices become more prevalent in the home), it’s going to be more important for companies to have a back-up plan in place in case these services go down.\nIn short, it’s fine to have a dependency — like storage or computing in the cloud — just as long as companies have a way to account for their dependents.'
